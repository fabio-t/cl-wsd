the irish interest in this particular amending directive centres around a request by our country to permit pre-export tb testing to take place at assembly centres , rather than only at holdings of origin as the practice now is in ireland ; i understand that we have about two years to discuss with the commission any difficulties we may have in relation to this and i am pleased to see the commissioner here today . test

from the earliest stages in the bovine tb eradication scheme , the department of agriculture has recognised the benefit of pre-movement testing , and we request that our particular amendment to the amending directive be looked on favourably . test

i understand considerable work has been done on laboratory-based blood tests for tb . laboratorio
the gamma-interferon test is the most promising of these , and is used under practical field conditions as an adjunct to the tuberculin test in herds . test
i would like the commissioner to indicate where that now stands and how quickly we will be able to have a blood test accepted by the eu . test

general product safety - bse tests test
perhaps i might continue with the other aspect of my presentation to parliament this afternoon , which deals with the proposal for the introduction of bse tests , and i have pleasure in presenting this to parliament this afternoon . test
i have announced on several occasions that i consider the new rapid post-mortem tests to be one of the most important tools in our efforts to control bse . mortem
the commission ' s services have worked on a proposal to introduce these tests in bse monitoring throughout the community since september last year . test
currently we have three different tests which have been found to give excellent results when used to test animals with clinical signs of disease after their death . test
the tests offer new opportunities to test a large number of animals on a routine basis . test
an active monitoring programme carried out in switzerland has demonstrated that the use of rapid post-mortem tests could significantly improve the efficacy of bse monitoring , particularly if targeted on animals which die on farms or are sent for casualty slaughter . test
the commission now proposes to replace that programme with a new programme where each member state tests a representative sample of dead-on-farm and casualty-slaughtered cattle in its territory . macellato
i am also happy to be able to tell parliament that these particular tests will produce a result within 24 hours . test
we propose to test a minimum number of 65 000 animals per year in the whole community , and the testing will start in january 2001 . test
parliament has been calling for the bse test to be made compulsory since the bse control committee . test
i have asked you time and again for quite some time now : do you not consider that making the test compulsory as late as january 2001 is too little by a long chalk and much too late , given that the bse tests were assessed a year ago ? test
do you also not consider , mr byrne , that taking dead animals and sick animals is not good enough and that you will only get a proper overview , i.e. carry out proper screening , by testing one animal in every five , six or ten thousand to be slaughtered , depending on the bse status of the member state ? test
furthermore , a number of member states have already announced that it is their intention to bring forward their own testing at member state level , and it may very well be that we are going to have member states introducing these systems in a shorter space of time . test
the testing is not systematic or is limited to sick animals or dead-on-farm animals , and so we are in no way giving the impression of adopting a quasi-systematic , and hence reliable , approach with regard to meat quality and to the epidemiological policy which might be implemented . test
will these tests also be carried out in austria ? controlli
just in order to concentrate the minds of the member states , can we ask what the commission , and indeed the svc , have concluded as a result of the tests which have been carried out in switzerland with regard to the number of animals , either by number or proportion , which have entered the human food chain ? test
i would also draw your attention to the fact that recently mr glavany , the french minister of agriculture , announced his intention of putting in place approximately 40 000 tests of the type that i have been discussing with you here this afternoon to determine the presence of bse and the levels of infectivity in france . test
however , i hope for all our sakes that the 2001 budgetary procedure will not necessarily put our endurance to the test once again and will be marked by greater consensus . prova
normally a great many tests are carried out on laboratory animals in order to determine whether the substance is harmless , and at what dosage it may be safely consumed . sperimentazione
on the one hand , the human being does not always react in the same way that animals do , so extrapolating from the results of tests on animals to human experience is always problematic . sperimentazione
at the moment we have , to name but a few , initiatives such as slim , the business test panel , the regulatory policy guidelines and the better law-making report , not to mention the initiatives relating to codification or the quality of legislation . test

we feel that such an occurrence would put both relations between israel and iran and stability in the already sensitive middle east to the test , which is why the european parliament must send a strong message to iran today , a message stressing the need to respect human rights , respect the international conventions which iran has signed and grant a moratorium on the death penalty . prova
just one comment if i may : i understand that on various occasions colleagues may want to test the quorum . verifica
it is also important , and here too another proposal needs improvement , for us to hold further discussions on the rapid bse tests . test
i would also add that , when we talk of the possibility of introducing tests , for example in the event of dispute between the commission and member states or in the event of dispute between the commission and third countries , carrying out tests can also help to decide if a country belongs in risk category i , ii or iii if , for example , certain statistics cannot be organised differently . test
one of the important measures recommended in the regulation is the establishment of rapid diagnosis tests , because rapid detection is one of the keys to combating this disease . test
consequently , these tests , which produce results within a relatively short period of time , will most certainly help us to take immediate and appropriate action . test
three tests have already been proposed , although we predict that we shall see future improvements in this area , together with rapid diagnosis tests on live animals , so that we can monitor better how the whole epidemiological picture of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is developing in the european union . test
a second key measure is to establish an ongoing epidemiological study based partly on laboratory tests using an established protocol . esami
the introduction of uniform procedures and truly comparable results from analyses by national and community reference laboratories will help us to monitor the situation closely and to create reliable scientific data and methods of diagnosis which include rapid diagnostic tests . test
secondly , there are tests for a rapid diagnosis and to identify tse in cattle . test
i welcome the availability of rapid diagnostic testing for improved detection of tses in cattle and believe , commissioner , that further consideration should be given to its use as a means of establishing the health status of animals in member states . test
all possible resources must be used in order to assess the bse situation in the various countries , particularly including the development and systematic use of fast screening tests . test
the important thing , then , is to have systematic recourse to testing whenever an animal dies of unknown causes . test
systematic testing precludes fraud and makes it possible to offer better guarantees . test
we still have no tests for live animals . test
and of course i support mrs grossetête : naturally , tests must be carried out on animals which have died from unknown causes but that is already included in the commission ' s proposal on the tests . test
the tse proposal being put forward includes , among other things , a requirement for educational programmes for farmers , vets and officials ; the removal of a list of specified risk material , an active surveillance programme using rapid post-mortem tests ; and the strengthening of the ban on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminant animals . esami
once we get to the stage where we have a vaccine or some way of identifying or testing if an animal has bse , then there is an argument for testing the rest of the herd and if there is a trigger level whereby it goes beyond that , then the whole herd should be taken out . test
the priority is to protect consumer health , particularly against diseases like tse , the mode of infection of which is not adequately known and the testing of which so far is only possible after the symptoms have developed . diagnosi
hopefully , better tests than the current ones will soon be available , and when the time comes , it will be important that the currently approved regulations are kept up to date with the advances in technology . test
the commission will , however , be monitoring the situation closely both through the recently agreed measures on random testing for bse and in the forthcoming proposal on animal waste . test
i also accept amendments nos 10 and 49 to article 3 , with a slight reformulation to create the possibility of delegating the evaluation , not the approval , of tests to an external body . test
with regard to epidemiological surveillance : i accept amendment no 15 to article 7 , introducing the mandatory use of the rapid diagnostic tests in the annual monitoring programme . test
let me add , however , in passing , that we will keep under constant review the scope for increased testing of animals for bse . test
on specified risk material : unfortunately i cannot accept amendments nos 16 , 17 , 18 , 40 and 41 to article 8 , bringing under codecision the approval and conditions for use of rapid diagnostic tests . test
nor can i accept that tests should be capable of detecting infectivity in all products and at all stages of the disease . test
even though i know there are rigorous tests and standards as to whether or not an extension would be granted , it should only be granted in the most exceptional circumstances and not for any willy-nilly ideology . controlli

these amendments were intended to introduce the possibility of systematically implementing rapid diagnostic tests , and to reintroduce the european parliament ' s request in the context of the follow-up to the recommendations on bse , i.e. withdrawing the entire herd from the food chain , banning any movement of animals defined as at risk , and advocating the slaughter and destruction of such animals , with the exception of animals intended for scientific research . test
above all , it would be an outrage if member states which have set up a screening programme based on tests far stricter than the community programme were to be penalised , in terms of classification with regard to bse-related risks , in comparison with states which have confined themselves to the minimum community programme . test

in respect of the testing method , mr president , it is important to arrive at a uniform testing method within the eu that has been established by an independent scientific body comprising experts from different related disciplines who would then be required to develop the testing methods . analisi
each member state should then appoint a competent laboratory , either on their own territory or not , as the case may be , and tests carried out in these recognised laboratories should then have to be recognised across all member states . analisi

there is still no scientifically approved method for migration tests which could partly replace the proposed legislation , and no such method should therefore be alluded to in the legislative text . test

secondly , on the wider issue of pvcs in general , how soon will we get the kind of migration testing from which phthalates ' safety can be assessed and the review which is called for in one of the amendments ? test
we also need information about when the substitutes which the industry may introduce will be open to equivalent testing . test
reliable migration tests in respect of phthalates are not available , however . test
instead i support the development of tests to determine migration limits , and for these to be legislated on in due course , rather than a long-term ban as proposed . dovrebbero
it is particularly galling that , of the six named phthalates to be banned , five are not even used for children 's toys and only two are suspected on the basis of unreplicated tests on rats . test
there was one test on rats in which massive quantities of phthalates appeared to cause problems , but researchers have been unable to replicate this test . NULL
migration tests for phthalates are currently under development and will probably be available within months . test
we should wait until these tests are available and then , if we must , impose migration limits . risultati
furthermore , the commission cannot at this moment accept amendments which would introduce migration limits , but the commission accepts the amendments which provide for this to be reviewed when testing methods have been approved . analisi

the results of the european assessment , which were published in july 1999 , suggest that it is 10 to 300 times more sensitive than the three other tests assessed at the same time . test
the test exists , it is reliable , and it can be carried out on a massive scale . test
unless there is mandatory general testing , confidence will not be restored , for confidence cannot be restored by decree ; it has to be earned . test
why wait until 1 january 2001 before bringing in the rapid screening tests which mr pasqua mentioned just now ? test
i too do not accept the arrogance of certain member states which , since they do not apply the tests , are not pushing for regulations . test
consumers have lost confidence and , in order to contain this phenomenon , there must be systematic bse tests on cattle and sheep . test
i understand that it would cost upwards of eur 150 million to test all slaughtered cows older than two years in the european union . test
mr byrne did not say very much today , as he was widely trailed to have done , about testing . controlli
i am glad that we are still looking at the extension of testing on an experimental basis . controlli
there are still doubts about the validity of tests , particularly on younger animals , and we have heard from other speakers about the huge size of the herd in europe that would have to be tested even if old animals are to be taken out of the food chain . controlli
madam president , i am very pleased that the commission is finally making a strong case for universal testing , because as the situation in france demonstrates " he who seeks shall find " ! test
commissioner , i urge you to ensure that these tests are also carried out in other member states . test
it is not acceptable if germany , for example , does not introduce universal testing , but just tests in north rhine-westphalia , for fear of no longer having bse-free status . fregiare
that cannot , of course , be allowed to happen and i can therefore only hope that the commission will exert the strongest pressure on those member states that do not carry out tests because they are afraid of losing their bse-free status . test
firstly , there is the issue of the tests that need to be carried out , and i welcome the fact that we are not going to stipulate a specific age for them . test
furthermore , the recent tests that have been carried out in france of fallen stock have shown several hidden cases of bse . controlli
as far as carrying out generalised testing is concerned , i believe , certainly , that we must increase the number of tests , as indeed you have all called for . test
we hope that the number of tests carried out on the targeted cattle and sheep populations will increase . aumentino

how , indeed , can we restore consumer confidence in france and prevent the collapse of the sectors linked to stock-farming if , on the one hand , we put a total ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal by french farmers while at the same time authorising imports of meat from member states that continue to feed their animals with meat-and-bone meal and refuse to carry out tests ? test

meanwhile , the prodi commission has agreed to implement the fourth recommendation addressed to it and to allow applicants access to their own corrected test papers in a selection procedure . prove
the hope was also expressed that all other european bodies and institutions will follow the commission 's example and grant job applicants access to their own , corrected test papers . prove
we thought it legitimate for candidates to have access to their marked test papers , since access to documents is a fundamental right and one that is also recognised in the charter of fundamental rights we adopted this week . elaborato
in the same way , we find it entirely justified for candidates to be able to take the examination questions home with them after the test . prova
i am referring here to an amendment on the need to provide indisputable proof relating , for instance , to oral test procedures . esame
allowing the candidates to see their marked tests is a simple means of increasing transparency and confidence in the procedure for the recruitment of european civil servants . accorgimento
secondly , and where languages are concerned , the examinations take place , and are marked in , the national languages , and the tests are not converted from one language to another before they are marked . test
i can now confirm something which has already appeared in the white paper on reform of the commission , specifically in action 29 which is about improving transparency in a way which benefits candidates and in which it is stated that ' finally , pursuant to the european ombudsman ' s recommendation , the commission will allow candidates access to their corrected tests in all competitions launched after july 2002 ' . prove

mr president , the opportunity today to debate and subsequently vote on the maaten report in second reading is an important one , a test of parliament ' s ability to live up to the expectations of citizens , who want institutions capable of making clear-cut decisions . banco
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , 80 fatalities in europe from new variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease , and europe , its council of ministers , the commission and parliament decide to ban meat-and-bone meal and exclude cattle over 30 months ' old from the food chain without prior testing . test

we also need to make provision for results of tests to be controlled where necessary . test

swifter decision-making based on tests as opposed to draconian measures after the event would have cost considerably less and it would be too stupid for words , regarding this political policy , also on the part of the council and the commission , to say that from now on we will include the bill in the agricultural budget . test

the gravity of the situation has led our group to table a number of amendments highlighting the importance of earmarking the necessary funds for standardising screening tests and for compensation for them , as well as for massive aid to the cattle industry , which has been severely affected . test

moreover , i also regret the fact that the frontier effect test has not even been included in the social agenda and that the treaty of nice has not made any decisions with regard to regulation 1408 / 71 , which only complicates matters . transfrontalieri

on the idea of a proposal for a directive on the introduction of frontier effect reports , whereby member states would be required to test their legislation as to the effects for frontier workers , i should make it clear that it is already the commission 's task to ensure that all provisions of national legislation are compatible with the treaty and the secondary legislation of community law . verificare
would it indeed not be preferable to harmonise the compensation or the way in which the costs will be met , at the time that all tests need to be carried out , in advance rather than afterwards , thus ruling out any distortion of competition ? test

if , with the removal programme today , the thrust of the resolution is test or remove in the sense of preventive consumer protection and several member states test all their animals , while others test or remove , then by the end of the year the statistics will be meaningless and we must avoid that at all costs . testano
we have learned , for instance , that one member state allows the inclusion of untreated specified-risk materials in feed mixes , that others are not managing to remove the spinal column at the abattoir and that some of the approved tests have turned out to be rather ineffective in the field . test
lastly , i must ask some questions about the number of tests conducted by member states , because some of the figures pose problems , such as those from portugal , greece and the united kingdom , the country at the source of the epidemic , which conducts only 600 tests per day , as against 37 000 in germany and 150 000 in ireland , for example . controlli

with regard to governance , mr president , what is required more than a reflection , which is currently very fashionable and rather ethereal when it comes to new forms , is to take up the tried and tested democratic practices which enable us to understand the messages of pericles , 2500 years ago , for example . eterea
while i have always favoured the application of safe and tested genetic research to agriculture , equally its practical application in future must be tempered by inevitable changes to agricultural practices resulting from the unrelated but nonetheless devastating consequences for farmers and consumers resulting from bse . temperata
the way in which the tests are funded varies from country to country . test
as far as the costs of the test are concerned , may i remind you once again of what i said earlier in reply to mr böge 's question . NULL
the question of removing risk material and , more importantly , the question of whether the meat is from animals which were tested and whether the country in question guarantees that the animals were not fed with feedingstuffs containing meat and bonemeal are clear and this must be implemented accordingly . test
this means that tests are carried out before storage , and above all each member state can make its own decision . test
it is obvious from the testing that has been taking place , at least in my own country , that all of the younger animals and animals over 30 months that have been tested are not in any way reacting positively to the test . test
turning to mr hyland 's question about tests , let me make one thing crystal clear : our first goal must always be to guarantee consumer safety . test
that is why we believe that it is of paramount importance for all animals over 30 months old to be tested , even if individual animals then have to be disposed of . sottoposti

eur 60 million will be transferred from the reserve to finance the agreed bse tests . test

of course , eur 971 million is not enough by far given the serious nature of the situation ; it is merely a starting point to mainly fund the ' purchase for destruction ' scheme and possibly the screening tests , if necessary . test
the testing of all animals over 30 months and the removal of specified risk material should go a long way in restoring consumer confidence . NULL
for example , in ireland , out of 48 000 cattle tested there has not been one reactor to the bse test , and to me that is an indication that the disease is confined to other animals in the suckler cow and dairy herds . test

admittedly , the resolution also calls for testing and labelling guarantees , but amendment no 6 , which lays down liability and insurance obligations , was rejected . test
five years after its entry into force it is now time to test its roadworthiness . esaminarne
the sixth amendment of the cosmetics directive , for which i also had the honour of being rapporteur some years ago , clearly provides , for example , that in a number of stages an absolute final date should be set for animal testing for cosmetics , a date after which no more animal testing should take place . sperimentazione
i would ask that we all bear in mind that there are now more than 8 000 tested ingredients which people can use quite happily . testate
this test and marketing ban - in effect a sales ban - from the sixth amendment has been converted by the commission into a straight ban on testing in the territory of the european union . sperimentazione
this therefore means that in the future , people will be able to carry out tests on animals quite easily , for as long as they wish , just a few kilometres further away . sperimentazioni
in the intervening time there should then be a labelling system so that consumers know , and it is fair that they should , whether they are buying products which have been tested on animals . sperimentati
the committee ' s opinion focuses on the examination of the ban on animal experiments in testing cosmetics specifically from these points of view . sperimentazione
to speed up the introduction of alternative methods , our committee is suggesting that a ban on animal experiments in the testing of end products and cosmetic ingredients should come into force according to a faster schedule than that which the commission is proposing . sperimentazione
regarding the marketing ban on products proposed by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , according to information received by the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , it may be that a marketing ban , a sales ban , on cosmetic products that have been tested using animals is in conflict with wto regulations . testati
as draftsman of the opinion of the committee , i see it as a problem that may arise , but i also understand the view of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy : we have to test the limits of the wto position . tastare
the aim must be to impose a ban in the eu area on tests using animals and the marketing of products that have been tested on animals . sperimentazione
the rapporteur has also hopefully discovered a way of influencing policy in the council for the implementation of swift measures by calling for an immediate ban on the sales of products tested by using animals . testati
mr president , the commission 's proposal for a ban on the testing of cosmetics on animals - but only within the european union - is totally inadequate . sperimentazione
it will allow us to pretend that we are doing something to prevent animal cruelty , but while maintaining the same testing requirements not one fewer animal would suffer . sperimentazione
our emphasis is on saying that the industry should spend a little less on marketing and a lot more on developing alternative testing methods . sperimentazione
the commission did not actually deliver on what was promised in relation to the testing ban , as has already been pointed out by mr davies . sperimentazione
it is a complete cop-out because the testing ban is just going to ensure that eu multinationals will carry out animal testing outside the eu but the products will still be for sale here . sperimentazione
what we need is both a marketing sales ban and a testing ban and we must do that now . sperimentazione
this will actually encourage more animal testing . sperimentazioni
as mr davies just pointed out , it is trying to flatter our vanity suggesting we really need to continue testing on animals so that we remain clean , so that we can actually correct body odours ; in other words , that we can improve on nature and change our appearance . sperimentazione
if you look through the information from the industry there is not one photograph of what animal testing really involves and the consumers should know about that as well . sperimentazione
mr president , the amendment to the directive on cosmetic products has provoked intense debate on the issue of animal testing . sperimentazione
the text seems to have abandoned the idea of a marketing ban on new cosmetics tested on animals and prefers to confine itself to a ban on testing cosmetics on animals within the european union . testati
animal testing represents only a very small part of cosmetic testing and , besides , it is destined to be phased out within ten years , thanks to research undertaken by laboratories to find new types of testing to replace it . NULL
furthermore , the general strength of feeling for an immediate and outright ban on animal testing seems quite strange , at a time when tens of thousands of animals are being slaughtered on our farms , without any hesitation whatsoever , in order to combat foot-and-mouth disease which could be eradicated with a mere vaccination . sperimentazione
an immediate ban on animal testing may also lead laboratories to carry out their testing on people , who are so poor that they are forced to accept anything in order to survive . sperimentazioni
basically , if we interfere too much in the work of our industries , the latter will take their business outside of the european union so that they will be able to compete with other countries and particularly the united states , since testing on animals will not be banned there . sperimentazioni
however , commissioner , when , as i point out in an amendment supported by over 50 members of parliament , it is a matter of new cosmetics containing new ingredients which have never been tested in the past in order to establish their toxicological profile in laboratory animals , then , as a scientist , i am convinced that it is essential to carry out an initial set of experiments on animals before cosmetics are used by human beings and before they are placed on the market . testati
if new cosmetics are not tested on animals , i would like to make it quite clear that this could lead to potentially toxic risks for men , women and children alike . there would be a risk of toxic effects on the liver and nervous system , and even cancer . sperimentazione
finally , it would appear absurd , moreover , both in scientific terms but also in terms of existing international agreements , to prevent the marketing in europe of those very cosmetics which are the safest because they have been tested on animals in the past . sperimentazione
many in the industry not only accept the need to end animal testing , but have also put their own resources to that end . sperimentazione
but now the industry has to demonstrate that it has a realistic timetable for developing alternative tests . test
we shall all be happier still when we can use them with a clear conscience , knowing that unnecessary animal testing has gone for good . esperimenti
mrs roth-behrendt also proposes a total marketing ban on animal-tested cosmetic products which is to come into effect five years after the adoption of the directive , even if no alternative testing methods are available . sperimentazione
this strategy may be in danger of temporarily restricting product development in the cosmetics industry , but it will considerably increase the incentives for developing alternative testing methods that do not involve animal experiments . sperimentazione
in this connection , i would ask you to pay particular attention to amendment no 39 , which proposes that animal-tested products should be required to be labelled with the words , ' tested on animals ' . sperimentato
the issue of animal testing has been of concern to this parliament for a long time and is also reflected in the level of lobbying by constituents who want to keep the ban on marketing cosmetics . sperimentazione
it is time for us to ensure that action is taken ; that the concerns of our citizens and those who care about animal welfare are properly addressed by a complete ban on sales of cosmetics tested on animals and a testing ban . testati
there can be no justification for making animals suffer in tests when there are proven , effective and safe alternative testing methods and 8 000 cosmetic ingredients already in use . test
it would not endanger consumer safety and it would certainly force the cosmetics industry to speed up development of the alternatives which we know are available and which can be developed by alternative testing methods in future . sperimentazione
and now the proposal is to replace the marketing ban for cosmetic products with a ban on animal testing in the eu . sperimentazione
one more thing for the benefit of the scientists here in the room , animal tests are not 100 % reliable . sperimentazioni
colleagues , without doubt , there is major and well-grounded public abhorrence about the use of animals for testing ingredients in cosmetics , and all concerned want better protection for animals worldwide . testare
without doubt much of the responsible sector of the cosmetics industry has taken considerable strides in moving towards fewer tests on animals , but public opinion is well-grounded and it is good that it has been reflected , not just in the past , but strongly reiterated and strengthened in the roth-behrendt report . test
nevertheless , it may well be that the international cosmetics industry draws back from a wto challenge if they know that the full glare of public scrutiny is focused on testing ingredients on animals . sperimentazione
mr president , the key and emotive issue regarding this debate and this directive is how to protect the health of children and adults while ensuring the phasing out of animal testing within a reasonable timescale . sperimentazione
as we know , cosmetics , like chemicals , pesticides and medicines , have to go through rigorous tests before they can be placed on the market for human use . test
the scientific committee on cosmetics sets guidelines on the sort of tests that should be carried out and these include animal tests . test
the key is to get the test and any alternatives to existing tests into annex 5 of the dangerous substances directive . test
when we seek , as we do , an end to animal tests , we have to take account of human interests too . sperimentazione
it would be horrendous if a child were to suffer or even die because an inadequately tested product was allowed on the market ; and we have to remember that items such as toothpaste and medicated shampoos are classified as cosmetics . testato
the industry , to be fair , has made giant strides in reducing both the number of animal tests and the number of animals used in such tests . test
in some cases they have replaced the test ; in some they have refined it to reduce suffering ; and in some they have reduced the number of animals used . test
the commission 's proposal would ban animal testing within the eu , but that would simply send such testing to non-eu countries where standards of animal welfare may be much lower . sperimentazione
the rapporteur has wrestled , as only dagmar roth-behrendt can , to find an alternative ; and if her alternative is to ban the marketing of any products that have been tested on animals , then that is fine ; but on its own that could bring an end to research and improvements , including improvements to the health of children and adults , if no alternative is available . testati
of the twelve tests required for cosmetics , three have alternatives now , a fourth is in the pipeline , four more have been refined or reduced , four have no alternatives even on the horizon . test
we must set realistic marketing and test end dates for each . sperimentazione
we must stop manufacturers and retailers claiming their products are not tested on animals when one or more of the ingredients have been so tested . testati
the only products which would no longer be sold would be those for which animal tests had been carried out after this cut-off date . testati
i am simply convinced that with the ingredients which are available and have been tested we are already able , even today , to produce any toothpaste in the world and also , for me , any kind of lipstick , of which i am so fond . testati
then , some people have said , but there are already tests . test
yes , there are : artificial tissue is used for in vitro tests . sperimentazioni
i should like to make one final point : if we decide on a test ban today , but also a marketing ban in a few years ' time , we need to have a labelling system for the interim period . sperimentazione
three points are of particular importance to me : optimal consumer protection , a clear label and , as a general rule , the avoidance of animal testing . sperimentazione
we can only guarantee this optimal safety by having numerous scientific tests . test
scientists are busily researching new test methods which deliver reliable research results and at the same time avoid the need for animals to suffer . sperimentazione
it is our declared objective to bring to an end the era of animal testing . sperimentazioni
in the future there must be no tests on animals for products and their constituents which have already been investigated once and for which reliable results are available . sperimentazioni
that is why in exceptional cases , where there is no alternative , we need to allow animal testing until further notice , above all when the optimal protection of infants , children , the sick and older people is at stake , including with respect to shampoos and creams . sperimentazioni
that is why we have to permit the member states to allow animal testing for cosmetics for two years longer than is currently laid down , provided that there is no alternative . sperimentazioni
in certain cases it is quite simply necessary to carry out tests on animals , in particular where acute skin and eye intolerances are concerned . sperimentazioni
this is about consumer protection and safety with a minimum of animal testing while encouraging the use of alternative methods . sperimentazione
we therefore support a comprehensive ban on these tests . sperimentazione
it is only a combination of marketing and testing bans that can be really effective , which is why we obviously support a marketing ban too . sperimentazione
on the contrary , the eu ' s implementing this ban might also open the way for a worldwide trend whereby more countries follow suit and adopt the legislation we have in place and the methods we have developed for alternative testing procedures . sperimentazione
the commission is well aware that the debate on animal testing is a very difficult and sensitive one . sperimentazione
actually , i personally think that it is important for larger parts of industry to be responsible for developing new alternative testing methods . test
the whole issue of chemical policies is of vital importance here because more and more new tests are needed and for that reason we need more efforts to create alternative methods quickly . test
on the issue of animal testing , the commission understands and shares the objective of parliament to reduce animal pain inflicted during experimentation . sperimentazione
the aim is to ban animal testing for cosmetics within the eu and to make the use of alternative methods mandatory at the earliest opportunity while respecting our international commitments . test
in the meantime , the commission will continue its efforts to bring about the elimination of animal testing both at home and internationally . sperimentazione
no migration testing is available to test how much of these chemicals enters people 's bodies . test
but because the changes parliament wants to make to this directive are so fundamental , we would like to send it back to the commission to allow them to rewrite it to take into account the marketing ban and take a more realistic view of the alternative testing methods that may be available , not using animals . sperimentazione
the united kingdom has already banned animal testing . test
i welcome the adoption by the european parliament of the report by german socialist mep dagmar roth-berendt , which calls for a ban on the testing of animals and the introduction of proper labelling so that consumers can make an informed choice . esperimenti
today 's debate on a report on the use of animal testing and ingredients in cosmetics and toiletries raises concerns about the use of allergy-causing ingredients , as well as substances used in cosmetics which have been linked with cancer and hormonal problems . sperimentazione
we believe it does a singular service by demonstrating to the commission and the member states the scale of public exasperation at the delays in phasing out live animal testing for cosmetic products . esperimenti
it is a vote to ban animal-tested products where alternative tests exist , to phase out animal tests over a 4-year period and to phase in a marketing ban in an agreed period thereafter . sperimentazione
we understand that , of the principal tests , roughly one-third can now be done by alternative methods , one-third are modified and one-third await effective resolution . esperimenti
the industry has everything to gain from using its considerable resources to advance alternative testing , and not for expensive campaigns of procrastination . esperimenti
in europe , 38 000 animals are used annually for testing new substances and end products of the cosmetics industry , after which they are systematically slaughtered . testare

the first initiative on the transmission of drugs for the purpose of analysis and testing is designed to avoid abuse as the result of larger consignments and is a perfect instrument in the fight against drugs . esame
even more briefly , on amendment no 2 , which did indeed come in my name : at that stage , we tabled this because we believed that if there was to be a vote through this parliament for tests at twenty-four months in all the member states quasi-imposed upon them by the commission , this needed to be amended with a provision that those member states which already have other forms of testing - or in the case of the united kingdom , the over thirty-month cow - should not have to go through that procedure . test
there has also been increased rigour in the reporting of bse and increased surveillance generally with new testing regimes . notificazione
on the other hand , amendment no 2 seems to be slightly excessive , seeking , on the pretext that animals under 24 months do not pose exactly the same problems as other animals , to eliminate the systematic use of rapid screening tests and to allow other countries , particularly great britain - the country that initiated this and the most affected - not to carry out systematic screening . test
thanks to parliament ' s input at first reading , the common position is , on the whole , acceptable : systematic test programmes , which will also apply to sheep in due course ; strict and clear rules with regard to specific risk material ; effective inspections especially on imports ; and market access legislation . analisi
bse tests for sheep and goats will be introduced as soon as the testing methods exist . test
our group considers the second amendment to be unclear and for that reason does not support it , especially if the aim is to lower the age limit for bse tests to animals which are 24 months old . test
these two amendments , as has already been said by other members , concern the additional guarantees that some member states can stipulate in order for animals to enter , and also with the possibility of conducting tests on animals of less than 30 months . analisi
however , after the adoption of new emergency measures for the community-wide removal of specified risk materials and the introduction of rapid tests for bse , a compromise on the legal framework came within reach . test
the council agreed to additional demands from parliament increasing the number of tested animals . analizzati
if i see any reason in the light of this evidence to reduce the current age of testing , i will not hesitate to take the necessary proposals . test
i would also add , in this respect , that research continues on more sensitive tests than are currently available . test
let me comment on mrs auroi 's remarks on the testing of sheep : i should point out that i am bringing a proposal on random testing of sheep very shortly . test
in the draft decision , we have foreseen as a first step 170 000 tests on sheep from october 2000 for the first year . test
i am sorry about this , but i look forward to a situation where the blood test for rabies antibodies can be verified and approved by the standing veterinary committee and the scope of the regulation can be extended to encompass ferrets at the earliest opportunity . esame
i would have been more open to the creation of a new category for ferrets with the requirement for vaccination , which is possible , but no post vaccination test can be foreseen . test

mr berlusconi 's new government and promised economic package may also be problematic for the commission , but it is particularly rich for the british chancellor to reject this criticism from the commission as interfering in sovereign british fiscal affairs , while at the same time making active plans for a referendum to join the euro , subject to his arbitrary five economic tests , which make no mention of the constitutional issues behind emu , which are dear to british conservatives . test
what is important to me about bans on particular substances is that we must only replace such substances with demonstrably better , sustainable and , most importantly , scientifically tested alternatives . testate
the directive in its current version provides for greater transparency , more active monitoring of the markets , a better definition of producer and consumer responsibilities - for that was still a stumbling block at first reading - stricter criteria for product safety and stricter criteria for testing these products . test
this makes our amendment no 3 especially important , because it provides quite simply for external certification by authorised testing agencies . controllo
if we think about the precautionary principle and prevention , it becomes clear that incentives must be created to encourage companies to have their products tested . dichiarino
i believe that testing by a third party , an impartial agency , would be an important means of easing the pressure on market-monitoring programmes . controllo

subject : testing cosmetics on animals and the wto under wto rules , imported products must be treated the same as ' like products ' of domestic origin . testati
it has been argued , therefore , that the introduction of a ban on the marketing of cosmetic products if they are tested on animals will result in a trade war as the process , i.e. not testing on animals , would not be taken into consideration . testati
this question relates to the testing of cosmetics on animals and considering the issue in the context of the wto . test
the commission shares parliament ' s objective of improving animal welfare and we fully acknowledge that placing restrictions on animal testing would contribute to the achievement of this objective . sperimentazione
we should be aware that , until now , animal testing is the only method used in most countries to assess the safety of products intended for consumption , particularly cosmetics . sperimentazione
as far as we are concerned , we remain convinced that there are other methods , aside from a marketing ban - which is parliament ' s position - which can be used to bring an end to testing the finished product and its cosmetic ingredients on animals . test
this is the purpose of the proposal that the commission made in order to ban animal testing within the european union . test
in our opinion it is the acceptance of alternative testing methods by the international community that will provide the most effective contribution to animal welfare . test
we are committed to encouraging the use of in vitro cosmetic testing , particularly within the oecd in order to move forward in this direction . test
mr president , it is very good to hear that the commissioner is not afraid of a trade war but responds very positively to the idea that these important political aims set by the european parliament , for example , such as a ban on the marketing of cosmetic products tested on animals , are political decisions , not a question of protectionism , and thus it is important that our representatives defend these issues at international level . sperimentazione

to this end , identical procedures for testing blood and plasma must be adopted which comply with the most recent techniques . controllo

mr president , the proposal for a directive setting standards of quality and safety for the collection , testing , processing , storage and distribution of human blood and blood components has come at exactly the right time , given recent developments in the medical and public health sectors . controllo
the primary objective in introducing new rules is to update the legislative framework , so that it covers areas not covered by community legislation , by tightening the requirements for suitable blood donors , plasma and blood tests and creating a community quality system for blood donation centres . plasma
the importance of tests has been emphasised here , and that is good . esami
but with hiv tests , for example , there is a certain window period , as it is known , when the virus still does not show up . ciononostante
particularly in the field of plasma-derived products , safety nowadays depends far more on sophisticated screening tests and inactivation steps . laboratorio

the rapporteur recognises this problem , but places too much faith in the availability and acceptability of non-animal tests . test
the european people 's party group did succeed in one respect : there was no majority in favour of double testing all chemicals . controllo
we must understand the fact that only a tiny minority of the more than 100 000 chemical substances in existence have to date been tested and that , furthermore , they are being produced in greater numbers each year . testata
given the risk that chemicals present to people ' s health and to the environment , we swedish christian democrats believe it to be obvious that , in accordance with the principle of ' no data , no marketing ' , chemicals which have not undergone certain tests should not be allowed to be marketed , either . test
i believe that this will be the decisive test by which laeken will stand or fall . tornasole
finally , as regards clarity and democratic accountability : it is essential that all legislation passes the two tests of acceptability to the council representing the states and acceptability to parliament representing the citizens , a double guarantee as to the quality and acceptability of european legislation . esami

having said that , there are some things in this report that i have set my heart on : the need to ensure that no payment is involved , the need for consent , and the requirement that there should be no discrimination , as regards employment and insurance , based on genetic tests . test
it is ambitious because it does not only deal with genome research , which is perhaps a fashionable topic , but it also discusses all the issues arising from and relating to that research : the uses of genetic information , the patentability of products and procedures derived from living matter , the conditions for genetic tests , cloning , research into mother cells and the research framework programme . prove
mr president , if europe is to be the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world , as proudly stated at the lisbon council , then we must provide the conditions and the environment which will encourage our scientists to test the frontiers of knowledge . misurare

as you know , there is already a harmonised framework for the developing , testing and authorising of biomedical products . sperimentazione
however , the results of this method have been tested in practice and proved that broader involvement did not help to consolidate or widen individual and social rights in line with modern-day requirements ; on the contrary , these rights were curtailed in line with the dictat of big business , giving rise to serious grass-roots reaction . comprovati
neither have we made any agreements on genetic tests . we have not reached agreement on whether , in european countries , something similar can be demanded when taking out insurance cover . test
that seems to me to offer some lessons for the barcelona summit next year : if we want to push forward the economic reform agenda in this sector and in others , we need to continue to rely on the tried and tested community method and not resort to the intergovernmentalism that frankly was implicit in much of what the council seemed to suggest in the negotiation positions it took on this package . comprovato
mr president , before doha , many of us were clearly aware that the issue of access to medicine was going to be the benchmark that developing countries would use to test our seriousness about whether we wanted to launch a development round . banco
as a result , we shall be tested during the next round of negotiations , on our capacity to remain faithful to this viewpoint , particularly when it comes to adapting our programmes of technical assistance for development to fit the ambitious negotiation programme which has been decided on . testati
i believe , too , that the test procedure we now want to make applicable will tend not to produce results significantly differing from those produced by the new worldwide test procedure that is currently under discussion . non
we can therefore rely on the test procedure for passenger cars . collaudo
it is also more important to stipulate that motorcycles should not achieve quite different emission values outside the test cycle , in other words that motorcycles are tuned only to the test cycle , and that electronic manipulation does not take place . collaudo
another important point applies as much here as to other types of vehicles , such as passenger cars , lorries and buses , namely that it is not enough for vehicles to achieve great emission values only on a test bed ; they must be able to keep to them throughout their working lives . banco
this stage would be based on limit values and test cycles that currently apply to passenger cars . prova
as you know , right from the start the commission has supported stricter limits for emissions as from 2006 , in compliance with the following principles : that we should employ a worldwide harmonised test cycle for motorcycles that reflects the actual way motorcycles are driven on the highway , with the corresponding limit values ; that we should employ a reliable sequence of emissions measurements in a new test cycle for motorcycles , so that new limit values may be specified in a way that is scientifically sound and in accordance with improved emission control technology . prova
a un / ece working party entrusted with the task has completed technical development work on a test cycle for motorcycles . prova

ever since lisbon , we in europe have had the ambitious objective of being the best in the world , and technology and science are of course part of that , although i am not primarily thinking of the electronic voting apparatus we tested yesterday , but of advanced technologies such as , for example , telecommunications , earth observation and ecology . provato

in my view , these two issues are : firstly , the distribution of fishing opportunities in community waters between the member states , maintaining relative stability , which is not a principle but a discriminatory mechanism by any reckoning ; secondly , the complete refusal to test , even experimentally , new management systems which are producing wonderful results in the world and in the great fishing powers - such as norway and iceland - by means of transferable fishing rights , which we are flatly refusing to even to test . provare
madam president , this report approves a directive stipulating that both goods and passenger vehicle drivers must have passed a special test in addition to their driving test . esame
i have to say that it is extremely important that public transport drivers pass these tests , and it is therefore important for this type of test to be introduced so that the pensioners and elderly people who travel by bus can do so in the greatest comfort and always say : ' what a good driver we have had today !

let us face it , bse is a dangerous disease , and it is actually scandalous that tests are done only from the age of thirty months . test
most of the animals that end up in the slaughter line have not been tested . soggetti
take great britain , where tests are still not being done at all , because animals over 30 months old are not permitted to enter the food chain , even though tests are , of course , necessary in order to establish the incidence of bse among animals that are not getting into the food chain . nella
there is a danger to sheep , so they too have to be tested . verifiche
the commissioner will be entitled to say to us , when we talk about inadequate testing , that the commission has said time after time that the real truth about bse was hidden because there was no effective testing . test
i am glad that mr olsson accepts that there is an equality of effectiveness between the way the uk takes out animals at 30 months and the slaughter of affected herds and testing of individual animals before they enter the food chain in other european countries . test
another concern is the compulsory testing of sheep . test
with regard to research policy , all means must be harnessed : research into the disease , methods of transmission , means of prevention , the updating of tests on living animals , etc . test
the european testing programme for scrapie enters into force this month . test
item 25 of the draft resolution that has been presented to us makes a timely insistence on the importance of this issue by emphasising the commission ' s responsibility to " ensure that the same safeguards are applied with regard to imports from third countries as apply to community products , in particular as regards bse testing , the temporary ban on feeding meat-and-bone meal and the proper removal of specific risk material . " screening
consequently , i wish to put forward the idea that , until there is scientific evidence to support it , we should neither gratuitously request that the age for obligatory bse testing be lowered , nor should we ask for the list of risk material to be extended . test
at some point , we hope that tests will show that we are at the level we were at prior to the bse crisis , namely a few cases per annum . test
infection is caused through the feed and is passed on down the breeding line . that is why the birth and feed group need to be traced and tested , and not the cattle accidentally sharing the same shed . test
there is a need for clarity about who , in the european union , is to bear the costs of additional impositions such as tests and investigations , and conditions for this must be the same from one member state to another . test
the provisions of the tse regulation need to be stringently applied , with tough penalties imposed for disregarding or fraudulently evading them , not only as regards the production and utilisation of animal feeds but also tests , regulations on slaughtering and the disposal of hazardous material . test
i welcome the strict prescription of effective tests for bse in all the member states , and also the demand that the age for testing be reduced to 24 months . test
imported food must be every bit as safe as that produced in the european union , and so tests for bse must now be made obligatory in countries outside the eu . test
in the meantime , i advocate testing for bse from 24 months . testare
tests should continue to be carried out at 30 months in order to obtain secure results . analisi
however , most of this increase was due to the impact of the generalised testing of healthy and at-risk animals with the newly available rapid tests . test
testing for bse has been introduced for all healthy animals aged over 30 months and for at-risk and casualty animals over 24 months . test

the issues i am referring to are the prohibition of animal experimentation and the prohibition of the marketing within the european union of products which have been tested on animals . sperimentati
the group of the european peoples ' party , however , has always believed that full compliance with this directive made it necessary for the rapporteur 's initial proposal to show a degree of flexibility , while allowing for certain exceptions since , although it is true that the majority of cosmetic products offer the consumer complete safety without their ingredients having to be tested on animals , there are certain cases in which scientists have still not been able to find reliable alternative methods for particular products which are not totally superfluous , such as sun products or creams testarne
without allowing the cosmetics industry to delay eliminating its animal experimentation practices , the proposal for a directive allows exceptions for very specific tests and for a maximum period of ten years . prove
no other issue has taken parliament so long to deal with as that of animal testing in the matter of cosmetic products . sperimentazione

what we need and what this report brings us towards is a ban on the marketing of products tested on animals . sperimentati
our aim must be a realistic timetable to phase out products which have been tested on animals by setting a deadline for each of those tests . sperimentati
i do not know whether this recourse to the oecd is just another symptom of the intergovernmental shift that has been affecting the council of late and i therefore believe that the rapporteur 's position is the most appropriate one : we must ban testing on animals in europe , we must move towards a ban on the marketing of these products and towards alternative methods . sperimentazione
i also support the idea that we should demonstrate our own responsibility - a concept which is foreign to the greens - by introducing a marketing ban as tests are developed where at present there are no alternatives available , even though we then have to set a deadline for these tests , perhaps ten years ahead . test
as regards the issue of animal testing , we all know how difficult and sensitive it is , especially because it creates a great deal of concern among the public . sperimentazione

banning cosmetic testing will not mean that consumers will be sold unsafe products , but will mean an end to a great deal of animal suffering . sperimentazione

the discussion now merely revolves around whether animal tests can be avoided altogether when they concern purely medical matters . sperimentazione
it is disgraceful that tests of this kind should still be used for luxury purposes , such as the production of cosmetics . esperimenti

this is why the committee on agriculture and rural development recommended to the commission last year that since we have opted to manage the programme in this way so that it involves a learning process which will ultimately be of benefit to the candidate countries after accession , why not implement other elements of rural development which we have tried and tested in a european union with fifteen member states ? adottano

it is not always clear how it is to be implemented , and the eevc tests are not taken seriously , in spite of the fact that they have been developed over a period of more than 22 years . test
we also believe that the eevc has made the most progress when it comes to methods of testing and that it can make further progress in this area . test
within the group of the party of european socialists , we should like to have gone still further in certain sections by , for example , placing significantly sharper emphasis upon the exclusive merits of the tests developed by the eevc and by setting a clear subsidiary objective with a view to obtaining a straight line of development in pedestrian protection between now and 2010 . test
i am an automotive engineer by background ; i have seen the test laboratories ; i have talked to the engineers about the problems of achieving more pedestrian-friendly cars . test
moving forward , she is right to say that we must look at a broad range of test measures . test
i call upon the industry this morning to join with the commission to put together a team of all the best talents in engineering and design , together with all other interested persons , to come up with the best tests possible , given today 's technology and not the 1998 technology on which the current eevc tests are based . test
as for its content , the four eevc tests will need to occupy centre stage , because they prescribe higher requirements and , in so doing , offer a higher level of protection for weaker participants . test
the inclusion of alternative test methods is , in our view , superfluous . test
as for phase two , i go along with these four tests where it is clear which ones are the best , but this is , at the end of the day , about a framework directive . test
that , mr bouwman , is why i cannot vote for your amendment no 9 , as item 14 of our motion for a resolution states that we expect the directive to take as standards either the four eevc tests or other methods offering at least equal or possibly better safeguards . test
this parliament should not behave in 2002 as if it already knew what testing methods will be right in 2005 and 2010 . test
so , mr president , as regards the question of which are the right tests for the framework directive , i ask the commissioner to submit proposals founded on objective criteria and modern knowledge . test
while the eevc and other test methods should continue to develop with new technologies , currently there are no equivalent tests , so those tests are for the moment standard . test
just as i do not think that it is useful to be theological about voluntary agreements or legislation , nor do i think that it is useful to be theological about a particular kind of test , but there are no different standards at the moment . test
the measures proposed by the european automobile manufacturers association - introducing more pedestrian-friendly car fronts , fitting all new vehicles with abs , installing daytime running lights in countries where this is permitted , and vehicle crash tests - should indeed make it possible to reduce the unacceptable number of people and pedestrians who , each year , lose their lives or are seriously or irreparably injured . test
in this context , it would appear fundamentally important for the european parliament to call upon the commission to guarantee the independence in both form and substance of the technical services certifying the conformity with the tests laid down of all new vehicle models that manufacturers intend to place on the market . test

specifically , we do not think it appropriate for the dominance test to be replaced by the criterion of substantially reducing the competence to authorise concentrations , nor for the commission 's powers of referral to be transferred to national competition authorities , nor for fines to be calculated as a percentage of turnover volume . dominante
for this reason , it is very important to ensure that the commission gives its pledge that the issue of definitions , but also the replacement of the dominance test , will not be held over until other occasions in the future when the regulation is reviewed again . dominante
the procedure used to test the market must be made completely transparent ; to this end , it will be necessary to listen to the arguments of the interested parties and to respond to their observations . occorre
while it is true that concentrations have developed the economic systems of certain countries , which , through their tried and tested stability , have been able to benefit from the opportunities they bring , it is also true that concentrations should be able to favour initiatives to strengthen international support , which must aim at introducing reforms to encourage integration in world trade . collaudata

the next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution ( b5-0490 / 2002 ) tabled by dagmar roth-behrendt on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy on the postponement of the ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals . sperimentati
in the sixth amendment to the cosmetics directive , parliament decided on a ban on the marketing of cosmetics that had been tested on animals , sharing as it did the conviction of most of the public that we have enough cosmetics and do not need more - toothpaste , shower gel , and so on - for which animals have had to suffer and die . sperimentati
in june , the plenum of the european parliament approved , on second reading , a modification - the seventh - of this directive which laid down the prohibition of the marketing of products which have been tested on animals , five years after its entry into force . sperimentati
it is clear - and the rapporteur knows this because we have talked about it many times and she agrees with it - that an immediate prohibition of the marketing of products tested on animals , which the application - which is already in force , i would remind you - of this sixth modification of the directive would represent , would at this time involve difficulties in terms of compliance which are practically impossible to overcome . sperimentati
in 1997 the commission purported to give itself a further power of delay and that was extended , although challenged , because all of us here - and everyone who serves as i do on the conciliation committee - agree with the rapporteur in acknowledging the difficulties which arise where there are not yet viable alternatives to some forms of animal testing . esperimenti
now at last , what has been resolved upon - namely , a ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals - must be put into effect with all force . sperimentati
the second point is to put european products on the markets of third countries at a disadvantage by continuing to carry out tests on animals , these are currently the only fully reliable tests . esperimenti
i believe that a ten-year ban which includes exemptions for three types of tests - namely reproductive toxicity , toxicokinetics and toxicity through repeated use - would be more acceptable . prove
i would therefore once again ask the commission to take account of what parliament has always stated , namely that animal testing for the purpose of cosmetics is unacceptable , that safety should always come first and that we are willing to help consider all the possible alternatives , and help weigh these up . sperimentazione
even now , with the seventh amendment , a legal amendment , under discussion in the conciliation procedure at this moment , we are reiterating that the industry , once this legislation is adopted , will have five years to go before there is an absolute ban on animal experiments and a ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals - and then another five years for certain special tests , the development of alternatives to which we can assume will take even longer . sperimentati
the situation is such that there are no comprehensive alternative testing methods at the moment and that is why we must ensure that there is legal certainty for these six months . sperimentazione

as i indicated in my earlier contribution , these inspections were suspended either because there was a ban on the importation of products from that country or because in the two countries in question there was 100 % testing in respect of all products coming from those countries . controllo
therefore it is important that they reveal any residues in any of the foods that are designated for testing . controllo
when the tests show positive , i want to confirm , as i indicated earlier , that these products are destroyed . test
a number of you raised the question whether there were doubts about standards and whether there was any pressure being put on the commission and on dg sanco in particular by other dgs in relation to the carrying out of tests or the changing of procedures , either by suspending fvo inspections in third countries or by not doing so . test
i have to assure members of parliament who raised this question that the decisions that are taken in relation to these kinds of issues - testing for residues - are strictly based on the scientific analysis and judgement of the technical and scientific staff in dg sanco , who give their advice as to the appropriate way forward in respect of these issues . controllo
on the question of when the inspections will be resumed , that will happen in the spring , but there is not much point in sending inspectors to third countries - or the ones i have been describing - to carry out tests to determine what we know already , to confirm the continuation of either a ban or 100 % testing . test
the only conclusion that is being suggested by those who raised this question is that , if these tests and inspections continue and if it is found that there are still residues or that 100 % testing is an inefficient and inadequate response , we should there and then decide to put in place a ban on the importation of foods from those developing countries . test
but i am satisfied , bearing in mind the rigour with which inspectors from the food and veterinary office carry out their work and the reports they make , which are made available to the public on the internet for all of us to read , as well as the work that is undertaken by the control authorities in the member states to ensure that where 100 % testing is required , that is done . merci

pressure to develop alternatives must now be put on the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries , which use the same tests . test
madam president , as we all know , it was the issue of a comprehensive and rapid ban on animal experiments carried out in the context of cosmetics testing that was the big issue in this conciliation . sperimentazione
although it is a bitter pill for us to swallow that the current marketing ban is to be extended by another five years as regards eleven tests and deferred for ten years in respect of three others , this is still a great forward advance in view of the member states ' unwillingness to implement it and of the subsequent attempt at even completely abolishing the marketing ban , which we were successful in resisting . test
there are now clear and realistic criteria for the development and marketing of alternative tests , so that parliament can count this as one of its great triumphs , not only for animal welfare , but also for consumers . sperimentali
by banning experimentation and the marketing of products tested on animals six years after it comes into force , with no possibility of extension , the directive puts the cosmetics industry 's back against the wall and undermines its ability to innovate . sperimentati

it was right that we moved the debate on to the end of the marketing of products tested on animals within the european union . sperimentati
we decided that a blanket target date was not sustainable and so we looked for a timetable , and as a validated alternative becomes available for each test , that test on animals will be banned . test
all such tests will be banned within the six years with the exception of the three to which the rapporteur has drawn attention , for which there will be a ten-year permitted timetable and a possibility of an extension of two years if , and only if , this parliament endorses that extension through codecision . esperimenti
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , the compromise reached by the council and parliament after much deliberation represents progress for animal welfare , as it will mean a ban on animal testing in cosmetics - as long as there are alternative methods available , of course . sperimentazione
i am also extremely pleased about the transitional period of six years to allow alternatives to be found , as there are only three categories of tests that are particularly difficult to replace and the industry has until 2013 to develop alternative methods for these . test
after all , ladies and gentlemen , let us be honest , which of you would volunteer to be tested with new substances ? offrirebbe

subject : endocrine disrupting chemicals and test methods test
in this context , the availability of agreed test strategies and methods to identify and assess endocrine-disrupting chemicals is a basic requirement for comprehensive legislative action . analisi
the commission participates in the oecd endocrine disrupters testing and assessment task force ( edta ) which was set up in 1998 . test
the main duties of this task force are to develop an internationally harmonised testing strategy and to coordinate and oversee the work of different sub-groups charged with developing new test guidelines , or revise existing ones to assess the potential endocrine-disrupting properties of chemicals . analisi
in addition the task force has defined a set of methods to be developed and validated : a comparison of sensitivity , relevance and reliability of the tests for testing the effects of endocrine disrupters on human health and / or the environment . analisi
the latest estimates are that agreed test methods for some environmental effects are expected from this year to 2005 while some test methods relevant for human health risk assessment are expected to be finalised between this year and 2004 . test
new validated and agreed tests for endocrine disruption will help a clearer identification of endocrine disrupters and allow informed judgements to be made on the likelihood of adverse effects . test
this research includes the development of novel testing methods . analisi
the reason for my question is , of course , that it is taking time to find these recognised test methods . test
now i understand that the methods for health effects will not be produced until 2004 ; these test strategies that are to be developed through oecd systems have become something of a perpetual motion machine . test
unless the substances are also toxic or hazardous for other reasons , we cannot even start to apply the precautionary principle , since there are no recognised test methods . test
on the contrary , we all feel a need to press on and ensure that we as quickly as possible obtain test methods and systems for working with these hormone-disturbing substances . test
what we are now discussing in connection with the new chemicals legislation is the fact that , as long as we lack clear definitions and clear test methods , together with agreed systems for using these , we must act on a case-by-case basis . test

the next item is the debate on the report ( a5-0103 / 2003 ) by mr liese , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation , procurement , testing , processing , storage , and distribution of human tissues and cells ( com ( 2002 ) 319 - c5-0302 / 2002 - 2002 / 0128 ( cod ) ) . analisi
the commission 's proposal sets out requirements for the donation , procurement , and testing of all donations of tissues and cells intended to be applied to the human body . analisi
this not-for-profit principle is relevant only for the act of procurement , not for further processing , manipulation , testing , or the manufacturing of products . analisi
it is therefore a matter of quality criteria , approval standards , qualifications , staff training , traceability tests , and the setting up of a european network bringing together the registers of national tissue banks . test
the proposed directive ' on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation , procurement , testing , storage and distribution of human tissues and cells ' is a very important piece of legislation and much to be welcomed . analisi

mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the commission 's positive intention is to tidy up ten directives , the first of which dates from 1966 , concerning community comparative tests and trials for various conventional seeds and propagating material . analisi
as the commission has confirmed over the past twenty-five years , agricultural crops such as cereals , fodder crops , and oilseed and fibre crops have been subject to community comparative tests on the basis of the applicable legislation . analisi
over the last few years , this exercise has grown in importance following new legislation on the marketing of propagating material of fruit , vegetables and ornamental plants , which lays down detailed rules for implementing the community comparative tests . analisi
the planned tidying-up exercise , however , would be neither complete nor relevant if the comparative tests funded by the european union were limited to currently certified seed and plants included in the union 's common catalogue . analisi
if i may return briefly to my first point , the comparative tests funded by the european union should not be limited to the species included in the common catalogue . analisi
tests of the same type are necessary for plants at risk of gmo contamination . analisi
to come back to my second point , it is important that the conservation species and varieties referred to in directive 98 / 95 should be defined and tested for marketing in accordance with special criteria , and that will require an implementing regulation , something which we are still waiting for . analizzate
finally , the directive already lays down that the community may make a financial contribution to the carrying out of the tests laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 . analisi
the same treatment should be possible for the special comparative tests needed for seed and plants produced and cultivated for organic farming and for the utilisation and conservation of genetic diversity in plants . analisi
for the sake of transparency , therefore , it will be necessary in future to establish a clear legal basis for a financial contribution , of whatever kind , and it is therefore necessary to make provision for community financial measures which will be applicable to these comparative tests and which will include the necessary obligatory community budget expenditure . comparative
the provision of eur 1 million illustrates , to my mind , how long it will take to be able to carry out comparative tests in this area . analisi
the burning issue at present is not comparative tests , but coexistence between seed containing genetically modified organisms and seed for organic farming , which cannot contain gmos by law . analisi
i welcome the commission 's proposal to simplify matters by drawing together and streamlining ten directives on the community comparative tests . analisi
for twenty-five years , comparative tests on arable crops have been carried out in the community on the basis of relevant legal provisions . analisi
the scope of these tests has further increased substantially in recent years . analisi
these comparative tests must not , however , be restricted to those seed and plant varieties that have so far been certified and listed in the union 's common catalogue . analisi
for twenty-five years , comparative tests have been carried out in the community on the basis of relevant legal provisions . analisi
the virus tests which are called for , for example , would result in very high costs , which could lead to a reduction of clones and thus a depletion of genetic resources . NULL
today , however , we are discussing the financial contributions made by the community for the comparative tests . analisi
on this i agree with various fellow members who have spoken and with the rapporteur herself on the need to take a broader view of the entire issue of testing seeds and plants . analisi
they are as follows : first , to introduce more stringent tests for the biodegradability of surfactants in detergents ; second , to expand the scope to include all four types of surfactants instead of covering just two types as at present ; and third , to introduce labelling requirements to benefit the consumer and the environment . prove
another important feature of the proposal concerns derogations for those surfactants that pass the old biodegradability tests , but fail the new tests . prove
at the same time , unnecessary testing should be avoided . prove
in this respect , toxicity testing will only be required if a member state specifically requests it in cases where doubts remain . prova
the testing requirements are therefore judged to be the minimum necessary consistent with a reliable evaluation , while at the same time minimising the amount of animal testing , as well as limiting the overall expense of the testing . NULL
the former can readily follow the provisions of the draft directive with its testing processes and derogation procedures , and there are always ample alternatives , but for the smaller specialised product this can be a brick wall which eliminates a useful , even a central , product . prova
they represent a significant step forward , tightening up on requirements for the use of specialist detergents , improving on the proposals for labelling of potential allergens , ensuring that consideration is given to the development of non-animal tests and setting the basis for proposals to eliminate phosphates , taking full account of scientific evidence . sperimentazioni
more specifically , with regard to the issue of animal experiments - we have already spoken about this enough in this house , amongst other occasions , when we had to decide on the cosmetics issue - we should encourage the use , wherever possible , of in vitro testing methods and other alternative methods . sperimentali
i therefore welcome the proposals extending the testing on biodegradability , making biodegradability regulations stricter generally and requiring clearer labelling and information . prove
this report also raises the question of banning animal testing . sperimentazioni
i am in favour of banning animal testing , provided , of course , that reliable alternative tests are available , in particular with regard to metabolites . sperimentazione
we must avoid repeating the mistake made in revising the directive on cosmetic products , which banned such tests without ensuring that reliable alternative methods exist . sperimentazione
toxicity tests are desirable and cannot be skipped . prove
these address a number of areas , including the complementary risk-assessments for surfactants that fail the ultimate biodegradability tests , so that a tiered approach can take into account exposure and risk . prove
i , however , feel that this regulation contains ever so many positive points , indeed where all parties are concerned , and , in my opinion , the question of toxicity tests is already addressed in the directive on hazardous substances , and so it is not necessary for those provisions to be duplicated in the regulation . test
as regards animal testing , the aims of the commission and the parliament are the same . sperimentazione
the extension of biodegradability testing to all substances and preparations at this stage would be a disproportionate and unjustifiable measure . prove

since chicken at the moment can be legally sold when it is 55 % water and is adulterated by other proteins which the perpetrators of this scam boast is pcr negative and , therefore , cannot be detected by most tests , is it not the case that there should be a more direct form of action from the commission ? test
i would like to hear from the commission that it will intervene not merely by recommending better labelling and better testing - though , of course , we need that - but by taking action to outlaw these activities , which are a total fraud on the public and are likely in one respect to cause serious concern , because the injection of beef protein - which the perpetrators admit has come from countries where there is bse , and they have not tested the products for that - may cause serious public concern as well . test

in its resolution , the european parliament essentially made two requests : firstly , with regard to form , parliament called for framework legislation to be proposed in this field , including a clear and realistic timetable for the application of mid-term and final objectives , as well as the methods for monitoring its application ; secondly , with regard to content , it requested , as a long term objective , the application as from 2010 of the four tests recommended by the european enhanced safety vehicle committee or other tests which would offer the same level of protection test
given the importance of this proposal to road safety and the timetable laid down for the application of the tests , as well as the consultation on the possible initiatives in the field of protecting pedestrians which preceded this proposal , the commission hopes that it will be approved at first reading . test
the report emphasises that the european enhanced vehicle-safety committee ( eevc ) test method should , above all , be a dynamic test method . prova
this is an important position : particularly if we are talking about enacting legislation whose aim is complete compliance with this test method , the method must also be kept flexible . prova
by july of next year it must be clear to what extent car manufacturers are obliged to implement the eevc test method . prova
it does not apply here , because the test method proposed has been tested on vehicles in the category up to 2 500 kg for 20 years . prova
it will interest colleagues from this committee to know that many of those young designers were designing pedestrian-friendly cars but , in order to meet the eevc stage ii tests , the only way they could meet those requirements was by putting the engine at the back of the car so as to leave enough crush space at the front . prove
anybody who thinks that these stage ii tests are a pushover , or are easily attainable with current technology , needs to take a serious look at what is going on in the industry and not sit in this house drawing up unrealistic amendments . prove
right up to the last moment , there was dispute about whether the eevc 's four test procedures should be prescribed by law as the sole solution . prova
there is no doubt that , even by today 's standards , these tests appear to be the most effective and the most cost-efficient , as well as to be the only ones available , but this is where criticism has to start . prove
it would seem that a development has been missed out on , as these tests concern themselves more with the protection of vehicles ' occupants than with that of road users put at risk by the vehicles . preoccupa
we in this house must neither stand in the way of the eevc tests being further developed on the basis of practice , nor fundamentally reject the development of alternative procedures that offer at least as much protection . prove
why , in future , should not such testing methods , and others like them - for we are talking about the post-2010 period - not bring even more safety ? prova
we propose accepting a combination of passive and active measures ( which in any event could have been included in another directive ! ) in the event that we replace the european experimental vehicles committee ( eevc ) tests , provided that these passive measures do not constitute more than 25 % of all the measures . test
the alternative measures to the effective eevc tests ( which have proven to be effective for more than 20 years ) should not therefore differ from the latter by more than 25 % . test
we concede that the eevc tests can be subject to a further viability study ( like the alternative measures which the industry may present ) . test
finally , we wanted to clarify that the alternative measures must , in all cases , maintain the same level of protection as the eevc tests , so that they protect all the parts of the body included on those tests . test

after years of tests , scientific analyses and expert opinions , we all know that fish consumption is on the increase : fish is healthy , the consumption of fish products – either fresh , smoked , frozen or canned fish – by european citizens increases year after year , and is also due to several effective advertising and information campaigns . sappiamo

the definition of ‘ surfactant ’ , additional tests , the derogation from authorisation , labelling , more and better information for consumers , are all aspects that genuinely broaden environmental protection and human health protection and that take into consideration the well-being of animals within the context of research for the development of products . prove

we have reduced the cost of registration in the higher 10-100-tonnage band by removing an expensive test from the data requirements . 100
. – the objectives of reducing chemical damage to the environment and to health , raising awareness of the consequences of the use of chemicals , improving consumer access , gradually eliminating and replacing the least safe chemicals and banning tests on vertebrate animals all touch the lives of the citizens whom we represent in this chamber . vertebrati
what brings it about is the fact that we will , in future , be transferring to businesses the responsibility for obtaining information and carrying out tests , along with the costs incurred in doing so . trasferiremo
that is the crucial change over against the law as it was before , and i think it has to be mentioned that it involves considerable costs , for these tests cost money – up to eur 200 000 ! costano
the agreement between conservatives and socialists will mean that no chemicals in consumer products will be tested . testata
i would ask you all to support the proposal by the committee on the environment , public health and food safety and the example set by the group of the greens / european free alliance , which would guarantee that chemicals used in consumer products have been tested . testare

how can you in the socialist group in the european parliament defend the way in which the testing of low volume chemicals has been hugely undermined ? indeboliti
how can you defend woolly criteria according to which high volume chemicals too can be exempted from tests designed to detect cancer risks ?  
a full 90 % of low volume chemicals may be exempted , and chemicals within the higher volume band are also exempt from proper tests . esentate
finally , whilst animal tests must be avoided where possible , progress remains necessary . evitati
i hope that people will be directly informed , on the basis of tests , of the dangers they pose . derivare
the slovak republic supports and recommends the approval of the ‘ one substance , one registration ’ system because it contributes to reducing overall testing costs and eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy . sperimentazione
since the objective of reach is to reduce the risks posed by chemical substances while avoiding price increases in final products brought about by high testing costs , i believe that it would be appropriate also to standardise testing charges , due account being taken of the weaker economies of the new member states . sperimentazione
there are still members here who would strip away the testing requirements almost completely : ‘ trust us , they are chemical companies ’ is their argument . sperimentazione
while groups of companies would be permitted to bring forward a single registration , separate registrations would still be allowed , making it much more likely that repeat animal tests will take place . effettuati
the proposal would allow data over ten years old to be freely shared , reducing if not eliminating the possibility that repeat tests would take place . ripetuti
the compromise , by contrast , only allows data over 15 years old to be shared , again increasing the likelihood that repeat tests would be undertaken . effettuino
this is completely unacceptable since , as well as being extremely cruel , animal testing is crude and inefficient . sperimentazione
the problems of extrapolating test results from animals to people and from laboratory doses to real life are now well documented . estrapolazione
many of these were adopted in the committee on the environment , public health and food safety , a move that has already helped to increase the pressure on the commission and industry to push for further work on non-animal tests . animali
however , if we are to seek a better approach we must not let this opportunity to force greater scrutiny of animal tests to pass us by . lasciarci
we must challenge conventional assumptions about animal test methods and scrutinise test methods with as much rigour as we scrutinise other aspects of this proposed new chemicals policy , because exposing animal tests to scrutiny will prompt the kind of debate we cannot afford to ignore . NULL
if we ignore it , then reach and all future chemicals regulation will be tied to test methods that deserve only to be consigned to history . sperimentali
proof of this cunning scheme to ruin the weaker members of society can be seen in the fact that chemical companies have pre-empted the proposal for a directive by carrying out the recommended tests on toxic substances , without any consensus having been reached on whether their findings should be shared . raccomandati
tests should be performed centrally on the most toxic substances in order to obtain reliable data , and these substances should be withdrawn from the market , in particular if they are carcinogenic or harmful to the reproductive system or other systems . per
a great many of them also still need to be tested in order to ascertain the effect they may have in the future on humans or on the environment . testate
therefore , the key is to get prioritisation , to make the system workable , to protect health , to reduce the number of animal tests and to achieve it all in ten years . animali
so , with our compromises and our amendments , we go for prioritisation , pre-registration , ‘ one substance , one registration ’ , data sharing , a balance between volume and risk , special account of the needs of small firms without sacrificing public safety , and mandatory data sharing to reduce and phase out animal testing . esperimenti
this is exactly the approach i believe should be adopted to draw attention to an issue that lies close to my heart , namely the testing of chemicals in tobacco and cigarettes . controlli
similarly , this regulation gives us an opportunity to test in practice and to be tested on a series of questions of concern to the union and its citizens . prova
there are many fine amendments to make reach more workable and less expensive , and to restrict the number of animal tests , but there are , unfortunately , still quite a few companies that are opposed to innovation and prefer to wallow in the unknown and do not feel like searching for safer and cleaner alternatives . esperimenti
it represents a huge setback , if instead of 30 000 substances , only 8 000 are subjected to the full test regime of reach , for then the uncertainty among consumers will remain , and the risk of allergies , cancer , and illnesses contracted at work will be perpetuated unnecessarily and potentially toxic substances will remain in the environment . contratte
i support the compromise on registration , together with the amendment to limit the cost for smes , and the minimisation of animal testing . esperimenti
it exempts too many chemicals from testing , and such requirements for testing as are in fact laid down are not strict enough to enable hazardous chemicals to be detected and phased out . esenta
i very much welcome and share the widespread support expressed here today for the need to avoid unnecessary animal testing . sperimentazioni
clearly , for now , non-animal alternatives do not exist for all the tests we need , so the role of ‘ one substance , one registration ’ to avoid duplicate testing is key . esperimenti
we also want the scope to amend the list of test methods approved as rapidly as possible as non-animal alternatives come forward . sperimentazione
i would also call for the costs of testing to be met by public funding , as this is the only way to avoid negative repercussions , in particular on small manufacturing firms . finanziati

the register of substances gives the european chemicals agency , also created by this regulation , the authority to demand more tests than those provided for under each category , should there be grounds for so doing . richiederlo
the sharing of data is strongly encouraged in this regulation and animal testing is only permitted if absolutely essential . sperimentazioni

no longer can we tolerate our people being used as guinea pigs for chemicals to be found in such everyday products as computers or toys , which are absorbed through the skin or the airways , and the risks inherent in which have never yet been put to the test . verificata

some wished the aptitude test for joining the bar of a host country to be retained and the permanent practice of the profession under the home-country professional title to be authorized . prova
others , conversely , wished the aptitude test to be eliminated and the practice of the profession under the home-country professional title to be restricted to a certain length of time . attitudinale
integration into the host-country bar is facilitated by the elimination of the aptitude test . prova
they will no longer be expected to sit an aptitude test under the directive on the recognition of qualifications , but will be able to prove their aptitude by practising the profession for three years . attitudinale
it would also be very useful in future - although a good deal of research is still needed - if we could find out not just after an animal has been stricken with bse that the sickness has occurred , but could also test for the disease , as it were . test
that is why i have asked the so-called weissmann group to propose some research projects , so that such tests might become a reality as soon as possible . weissman
indeed , certain safeguards built into the draft directive , and which can be seen as an attempt to ensure expert advice in cross-border operations , do themselves represent obstacles to the freedom of establishment , such as the restriction of the practice period and the retention of aptitude tests . prove
the general directive from 1988 on the acknowledgement of qualifications with respect to this sector has proved poor and inadequate , since most member states of the eu have chosen an alternative permitted by the directive involving the introduction of a compulsory aptitude test for professional practice , which in reality has hindered the free practice of the profession of lawyer . abilitazione
the commission has however chosen to give a special sectoral directive and to maintain the principle on a restrictive aptitude test . limitativo
i also welcome the objective of this report - to improve freedom of movement for lawyers by means of this specific supplementary directive - especially as the general directive fails to clarify the question of the right to practise on a permanent basis under the so-called home title , and because the aptitude test laid down in directive 89 / 48 has often been a real obstacle to the freedom of establishment of lawyers . attitudinale
however , the crux of this directive is the provision in article 10 which eases the existing requirement of an aptitude test . attitudinale
nor is it sufficient to measure the average values in noise tests . test
as regards access to the profession of the host member state , the aptitude test has rightly been abolished , seeing that a lawyer wishing to gain access to the profession of lawyer in a state other than his own is required to furnish evidence of effective and regular professional activity for a period of three years in that state . attitudinale

mr president , time is now getting short for completion of the talks on the comprehensive test ban treaty . esperimenti
china has finally agreed to things which may mean that it cannot conduct further peaceful nuclear tests . esplosioni
the bad news , meantime , is that india has announced today that it will not sign up to the comprehensive test ban treaty . cattiva
china 's recent nuclear test and the announcement that it is to carry out another one before september is a slap in the face to the negotiators . NULL
moreover , mr president , the american announcement that subcritical nuclear tests are to be postponed till next year is not exactly encouraging either and detracts from the credibility of this forthcoming ctbt . test
mr president , at exactly this time last year you will recall that there was worldwide condemnation of the french nuclear tests and this parliament told president chirac in no uncertain terms here in this hemicycle what we thought of his government 's actions . esperimenti
i deeply regret that the people 's republic of china has now carried out a nuclear test after the conclusion of the npt conference . esperimento
the chinese must understand that the continuation of nuclear testing is incompatible with implementation of the nuclear test ban treaty . esperimenti
the factual situation is that china is proposing that peaceful nuclear explosions should be reconsidered at a review conference ten years after the test ban treaty enters into force and that review should be automatic unless a majority of parties vote against it . esperimenti

can i assume that the people 's republic of china 's nuclear tests are safe , or somehow different ? presenterebbe
we have always been outspoken about condemning nuclear tests . esperimenti
now , just to get back to the comprehensive test ban treaty currently being negotiated in geneva : there must not be any loopholes to allow countries to conduct nuclear tests . esperimenti
if it is not watertight it means that certain countries will find ways of carrying out nuclear experiments and producing absurd arguments about how they are essential for world peace , just as mr chirac did during the debate on the french testing in mururoa last year . esperimenti
for example , india described its only nuclear test as a ' peaceful nuclear explosion ' , but it still used the results to develop its weapons programme . esperimento
the other sad fact is that this parliament does not really have the moral high ground to condemn nuclear tests after our failure on the whole issue of france 's nuclear tests and nor does the commission because the commission sat on its hands when it had the power to do something and it did not do anything ! esperimenti
the member states which let france go ahead with its nuclear tests all have dirt on their hands , so we cannot take the moral high ground here . esperimenti
mr president , there is no getting away from the fact that nuclear tests run counter to the letter and spirit of the nuclear weapons reduction treaties because they are intended to promote qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons , which is of greater significance than an increase in their quantity or their geographical proliferation . esperimenti
likewise , there is no getting away from the fact that china should cease carrying out nuclear tests immediately . esperimenti
mr president , if we want to steer clear of displaying double standards , it is important that we call on china to do what we called on france to do , namely to halt nuclear testing immediately . esperimenti
mr president , i am glad that , following the underground nuclear tests in the lop nor desert in china , honourable members have stressed in their motion for a resolution the importance and urgency of the question of the treaty on a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing . lop
this failure is all the worse because tackling this problem is increasingly becoming the acid test of european integration . tornasole

it is therefore right that we should allow medical tests to be carried out on those who cannot give their consent only in certain clearly defined and exceptional cases , as specified quite clearly in paragraph 12.1 . 1
if we do not specify this , there is a risk that any embryos left over will be used for tests , so we must make it clear that this is not allowed .  
paragraph 12.10 denies future parents the right to have genetic tests to detect serious congenital defects , and we have to wonder whether this is really in the interests of the unborn child . analisi
in such instances , it is often not possible to use people who are able to give their consent , so the tests must be carried out on those who cannot . incapaci

however , the justification is always given that with the nuclear deterrent , with the nuclear weapon , you have a seat at the top table , you can influence events in the wider world , and so i think in the european union we want in particular to ask the uk and france to use that influence and , with all of us behind them , to say , in particular to the chinese that they must stop testing nuclear weapons . esperimenti
this testing of nuclear weapons is an abomination , it threatens the environment , it threatens the vulnerable communities on the periphery of their own country , and just as we condemned jacques chirac when he came to this chamber in unequivocal terms for what was happening in the french polynesian testing , we do the same to china . sperimentazione

therefore , it is really important that we pursue in good faith to bring the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty to fruition . esperimenti
why were we testing nuclear weapons in the pacific last year ? sperimentato
the first deadline for the test ban treaty has passed and the second one is very close . NULL

many reluctant states were persuaded by the promise that a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing would soon be forthcoming . esperimenti
nuclear states which claim that the nuclear test ban treaty is concerned not with nuclear weapons but with nuclear tests are of course right in theory . nucleare
notwithstanding this there is a direct link between the nonproliferation treaty and the ban on testing . esperimenti

like the european parliament , the commission hopes that the members of the conference on disarmament will reach an agreement before 12 august 1996 allowing the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty to be signed before the end of the year , and so help to strengthen the conditions for international security and hence the security of the european union . esperimenti

under the provisions of this directive member states are obliged to accept , without undue delay and without additional tests , any licence issued to a pilot by another member state together with the privileges and certificates relevant to that status . esami
the directive also provides that , when a member state has reasonable doubts - after due examination of the licence presented for acceptance - as to the equivalence of the licence concerned , it may consider that additional tests or requirements are necessary to enable the licence to be accepted . esami

from free-fall tests carried out on actually existing surfaces , it has been confirmed that the quantity of deformation energy is equal to that absorbed by the container during reference tests when the free-fall height is much greater than 9 m , i.e. when the impact velocity is larger . prove
finally , if i might draw the commission 's attention to amendment no 15 , which requires consent from third parties to comparative tests that they have carried out if a company wishes to refer to those tests . test
as it is written in amendment no 15 it would be extremely cumbersome to seek and to get that consent from the people who carry out the tests as amendment no 15 states . test
in the pharmaceuticals sector , for instance , it is both customary and necessary to refer to comparative tests , so amendment no 5 would impose a particular burden there . prove
we quite agree with mr whitehead that it is perfectly acceptable for the regulatory bodies to which consumers can turn and which can rule on the objectivity of tests and comparisons to remain national . test
with regard to amendments nos 3 and 15 , referring to the use of the results of comparative tests - a subject which was raised by more than one member - the commission has concluded , after careful consideration , that the use of comparative test results for advertising purposes is linked only indirectly to the provision under discussion and hence to comparative advertising . prove
we feel that reference to these tests is unnecessary and can be omitted , given that our aim is to harmonize the provisions governing comparative advertising . prove
since this subject remains an important one , it might be more appropriate to envisage an ad hoc legal instrument , whereas if the aim is harmonization , we do not consider the publication of comparative tests to be essential at this juncture . test

roadworthiness tests veicoli
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( a4-0295 / 96 ) on behalf of the committee on transport and tourism , on the common position adopted by the council with a view to the adoption of a council directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers ( c4-0369 / 96-95 / 0226 ( syn ) ) ( rapporteur : mr belleré ) . 0369
the subject of roadworthiness tests is a complex one and no one would deny that there is a need to harmonize such tests throughout the union so that we can be assured that a vehicle deemed safe in one member country will be accepted as such in another . veicoli
amendments nos 1 and 10 seek to amend the ways of testing the carbon monoxide content of exhaust from a cold start . controllo
also we are not so sure that cold-start testing was not included in this directive anyway . controllo
three amendments where we can agree with the rapporteur are nos 2 , 8 and 9 - some of which seek to tighten up the regulations to include vehicles greater than three-and-a half tonnes that carry passengers , to increase the frequency of testing and to ensure the removal from our roads of vehicles that do not conform to the roadworthiness regulations . controlli
whilst my group appreciates the difficulties this may cause in the council of ministers , we cannot accept the fact that vehicles deemed as unroadworthy , having failed the approved test , should be given any leeway or time to put them back on the road . rimetterle
first of all there is the amendment which allows the member states to apply stricter tests in other areas than brake systems . controlli
also , unlike the committee on transport and tourism , we would like to leave the decision on whether or not to test vehicles of historic interest to the member states . lascieremmo
mr president , in the second reading , parliament is asked to give an opinion on a proposal for a common council directive relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers . veicoli
i am very pleased that from now on each member state will recognize the evidence provided by another member state that a motor vehicle registered in the latter , together with its trailer or semi-trailer , has successfully passed a roadworthiness test that fully complies with the provisions of the present directive . semirimorchio
i am sorry , however , that the common position has disregarded the obligation for member states to conduct tests on vehicles prior to the first registration and to carry out regular checks on speed limitation devices . veicoli
however , such testing presupposes monitoring equipment which is highly efficient in detecting defective or inaccurate speed limiting devices or ones that have been tampered with . controllo
we must therefore ask ourselves , and the commissioner is right in this case , whether all member states are ready to make it compulsory for their various testing services to be equipped with such test equipment , whose very efficiency makes it expensive . munirsi
as for the frequency of tests , it seems to me that amendment no 8 of the rapporteur , providing for testing three years after the date of first use and then annually , is the most reasonable . controlli
these task forces are a test of what we may find in the fifth framework research programme . test

they guarantee in particular that the tests i have mentioned will be held at frequent intervals and , at any rate , whenever necessary to meet demand . prove
they feel the tests they are being put to are unfair . prove
we cannot have an internal market on the one hand and , on the other , test the impact of projects on the environment in different ways in different member states . valutazione

the effects on human health , according to directive 90 / 220 , are to be tested by means of long-term studies . esaminate

i would very much like to have known whether this genetically modified soya produced by monsanto might in certain circumstances fall within the relevant period of time , and whether the tests really are equivalent to those that have to be undertaken in accordance with our directive 90 / 220 . esami
the aim of this directive is to protect human health and the environment , by means of strict approval procedures and environmental acceptability tests . esami
with regard to the health tests laid down by this directive , particular emphasis is given to the allergenic aspects of these products . esami
scientific tests on the soya bean have shown that this product is harmless to human health and to the environment , and that it does not cause any increased allergic reaction , compared with the traditional soya bean . NULL
the tests were therefore halted , and those soya beans were never placed on the market as a product . test
quite frankly , it is astonishing that the commission has seen fit to licence the imports of monsanto soya beans so quickly , when the tests they have passed in the usa have been minimal . test
testing and labelling , however , are absolutely essential for european consumers in all cases . controllo
we now know that seniority does not serve women , that written tests often put them at a disadvantage and i am convinced that it is more to do with the way the tests are compiled rather than the fact that it is women sitting them . prove

perhaps we should run a test and make it available only over the worldwide web , to find out how many honourable members really are connected to it . test

later this week the european parliament will debate a report about the commission 's failure to agree plans to phase out animal tests on cosmetics . sperimentazione
if you wish to test it out , you may do so on friday morning , when i shall still be in the chair . verificarlo

in 1993 , this house decided , quite clearly , that there should be no more animal experiments in the field of cosmetics , on the grounds that there are already 8 , 000 ingredients that have been tested on animals . sperimentati
any other new ingredient to be used for cosmetic products would have to be tested using alternative methods , i.e. in vitro , and not on animals . sperimentati
and will you also take note of the fact that most animal experiments have never been validated , which means that they have never really been put to the test , and that therefore they are of only very limited relevance ?  
and will this seventh amendment finally make it quite clear that no more finished products will be tested on animals ? cosmetici
even though the actual number of animals involved in testing for cosmetics is relatively small , our aim , like that of the rapporteur , would be to reduce it to zero . sperimentazione
we draw attention to the fact that it is not actually known how many tests for cosmetics within the european union involve the use of animals since most member states are failing to comply with the obligation to collect those statistics , including germany . esperimenti

surely we should test those rules to the ultimate . rivedere
mr president , the ban on the marketing of cosmetic products and ingredients which have been tested on animals is due to enter into force on 1 january 1998 . testati
if you look at the commission 's annual report , it shows that there has been a casual approach , a lack of effort to secure the implementation of a ban on animal testing in 1998 . sperimentazione
and if we look at paragraph 3 of the resolution , we see that the commission has failed in not even being able to provide detailed statistics on cosmetic testing in the union . test
the commission would have appeared in a better light if it had gone to more trouble over the international recognition of alternative testing methods . test
we must also not forget that there are already some 8000 ingredients which have been tested . testati
the commission would have done better to oblige the cosmetics industry to use these existing ingredients and finally introduce a ban on further animal testing . sperimentazioni
firstly , of course , because of the subject matter : this is an ethical question and it is totally indefensible to use animal testing in the production of cosmetics . esperimenti
of course alternatives are slow to appear when it can be seen that the ban is continually postponed ; we are contributing to this slow pace as there is no clear date by which testing must stop . rinvii
we support the report and would like to see a ban as soon as possible both on sales and on testing themselves . esperimenti
moreover , is it really cruel to test a product by applying it behind a rabbit 's ear or , at worst , by instilling it onto a rat 's cornea , to check that it does not develop conjunctivitis ? testare
i must stress that with regard to certain tests , specifically those for eye irritation , skin absorption , phototoxicity and photo-irritation , and those basic tests relating to mutagenicity , the commission report did evince a degree of optimism regarding the possibility of testing valid alternative methods . test
furthermore , the rules endorsed by the european union at the gatt negotiations do not allow us to prohibit the circulation within europe of foreign products that have been tested on animals . sperimentati
to eliminate any such possibility , at least for the time being , the commission should delay for a few more years the directive prohibiting the marketing of cosmetics that have been tested on animals . sperimentati
it is not true , for example , to say that there is no alternative to the eye irritation test . test
it is also complete nonsense , in this context , to quote a few poor prisoners on whom some kind of tests are being carried out . test
and all of you , ladies and gentlemen , who perhaps have a dog at home , and who think about what else you can do to make its life better , should just try to imagine how you would feel if it was your dog that somebody was going to test a cosmetic product on . sperimentati
i should therefore also like to give my support , in particular , to the rapporteur 's demand that research and development work aimed at discovering alternative methods for tests in the cosmetics field should be included in the fifth r & d framework programme . test
have i understood you correctly , in that you said that with effect from 1 january 1998 there will be no more animal tests for finished products ? tests

we urgently need a clear and full set of rules on genetic manipulation , indicating the safety tests which must be undertaken before new products are placed on the market . test
the commission should therefore immediately review that authorization and take measures , jointly with the member states to see that before any decision is taken on genetically modified products there should first , and i repeat first , be thorough and independent scientific tests plus a detailed public information campaign on the types of manufacture and respective composition . valutazioni
however , as one of the previous speakers mentioned , we need to set up clear procedures , safety dossiers , testing , certification , placing on the market which are more akin to the current procedures for medicines than to those for foodstuffs . analisi
the directive 93 / 35 / cee , adopted in june 1993 , planned , firstly , for ' prohibition of the marketing of products , ingredients or combinations of cosmetic ingredients tested on animals from 1 january 1998 ' . sperimentati
every year 30 , 000 animals die in cruel experiments to assist the production of cosmetics , despite the prohibition , in directive 93 / 95 / eec , of the marketing of cosmetics containing ingredients or combinations of ingredients tested on animals and the commitment to promote alternative methods to replace animal tests . testati
its systematic disregard of strong public opposition and of the resolutions of the european parliament constitutes an act of complicity in the barbaric torture of thousands of animals and is discouraging any serious attempt to develop scientifically acceptable alternative methods which could replace animal testing in the cosmetics sector . sperimentazione
it is pretty obvious that no real pressure is being put on the industry to engage in the research and development of alternative methods which can provide a high and reliable level of safety , and that the resources needed for serious research and technological endeavour towards meeting all of the safety requirements and ensuring that the abolition of animal experiments does not lead under pressure of competition to new products , with new and inadequately tested ingredients which may have unforeseen side-effects on the consumer , are not being allocated . testati
the eu has problems when it comes to restricting animal testing in general , and to banning such testing in the cosmetics industry in particular . esperimenti
regrettably , it seems that the commission is giving in to pressure from the industry and is totally unwilling to pursue a policy of promoting alternative testing methods . sperimentazione
in an effort to explain its inaction , the commission takes cover behind the fact that the usa has also failed to introduce a ban on animal testing in the cosmetics industry . sperimentazione
given that the european parliament - the representative of the people of europe - is calling unequivocally for a ban on animal testing in the cosmetics industry , there is no valid argument for failing to implement such a ban on 1 january 1998 , as council directive 93 / 35 / eec allows . sperimentazione
on the contrary , if products were to be labelled ' not tested on animals ' in a positive campaign , it could even represent an additional selling point on the world market , in the interests of producers , consumers and animals ! testato
the ban will not mean any adverse effects on consumer safety , and the development of alternative testing methods is already considerably advanced . prova
so when the commission states that a ban on the sale of cosmetics that have been tested on animals is not possible , partly because the usa does not have similar regulations , this is simply a pretext . testati
rather introduction of the ban in europe could have a knock-on effect resulting in international recognition of alternative testing methods . sperimentali
benchmarking can be applied at various levels : it can be used to compare systems , framework conditions , and structural factors which are the responsibility of the public authorities ; it can be use to test the efficiency of industry as a whole , or some of its sectors or subsectors ; and finally some - or all - of the companies that compose them . verificare

it would be more appropriate to test these new approaches and therapies fully and rigorously within the context of a tried and tested medical tradition , with a view to integrating those which prove successful into conventional medicine as soon as possible , so as to hold out to conventional medicine - which in the last few years has perhaps become too technical and equipment-oriented - the prospect of a more humane form of medicine , which views people as a whole and builds on their powers of self-healing . integrarli

mr president , after many years of negotiations and strong opposition both from nuclear powers and threshold states , it was finally decided to have a comprehensive ban on all nuclear weapons testing . test
the intention of a comprehensive test ban treaty was to stop further development of nuclear weapons . test
after the end of the cold war this was an obvious thing , even if france , against strong world opinion , first reserved the right to carry out a series of nuclear weapons tests to improve its nuclear weapons . test
many citizens were not convinced of the goodwill of the nuclear powers and warned that development of new nuclear weapons could take place through laboratory testing . test
unfortunately , we are now forced to note that the usa has carried out a series of subcritical nuclear tests and intends to carry out four more before september this year . test
some of the world 's leading nuclear weapon scientists have strongly questioned whether these tests are indeed subcritical , not least because they are taking place underground and are not verified . test
the argument that these tests have to be carried out in order to be sure about the safety and reliability of existing nuclear weapons stocks fails on its own absurdity . test
many countries and a large number of members of the american congress have expressed their concern over these tests . test
the crux of the matter , however , is that these tests and new nuclear weapons development seriously jeopardize the international test ban treaty . test
even if , contrary to expectations , they did not contravene the letter of the test ban treaty , it is clear that they contravene the spirit of the treaty . infrangano
this is one of our most important international treaties , and it is unacceptable for the usa to seriously undermine the treaty through these tests . test
our resolution therefore demands consequently that the american government should stop these tests , that it should state in an official declaration that these tests are not part of a new weapons development programme and that the development of new nuclear weapons is not part of the usa 's policy . test
this is the first resolution to be presented on the topic of nuclear weapon testing and sub-critical testing . test

madam president , ladies and gentlemen , do you remember one of the replies from president chirac of france to the protests to nuclear testing ? test

the next item on the agenda is a statement by the council on the nuclear tests in india . esperimenti
the european union is fully committed to the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty , which seeks to discourage the proliferation of nuclear weapons . esperimenti
the presidency is ensuring that the implications of this test are discussed by member states at the political committee on 12 may ' , which in due course took place . esperimento
the government of india has today announced that it has carried out two further tests , which it says complete the planned series . esperimenti
these tests have been carried out in flagrant disregard of international opinion . test
the tests are contrary to the disarmament process to which the overwhelming majority of the international community are committed . esperimenti
the five nuclear tests india has just carried out - we have just learnt , in fact , that there were two more this morning after the three the day before yesterday - are exceptionally serious . esperimenti
india now has a vehemently nationalist government , whose establishment almost everyone here regrets , but the fact that it has been possible to carry out these five tests less than two months after that government came to power shows that everything was obviously ready and that the whole nation was committed . esperimenti
madam president , the agenda says that we will have a statement by the council on nuclear tests in india followed by questions . esperimenti
i merely wanted to ask the council to refresh my memory : did it voice the same dismay when france carried out the nuclear tests ? test
mr smith , i assume that we both have the same agenda for today , and my agenda says the following : statement by the council on the nuclear tests in india , followed by questions , statement by the council and the commission on kosovo , followed by a debate . esperimenti
madam president , my group would wish to condemn these tests but we would recognise in so doing that this was a political explosion in response to a party political programme : and to that extent i agree with mr smith that it is actually very similar to the last french tests . esperimenti
madam president , the five nuclear tests are not making the situation any more comfortable in the meantime , and are undermining the momentum for nuclear disarmament which has been in existence since the end of the cold war , the signing of the ctbt and the extension of the non-proliferation treaty . test
instead , the united states is conducting subcritical tests and the start-ii treaty is not being ratified by the russian duma . test
madam president , the five underground nuclear tests which india has carried out obviously caused a shock wave throughout the world . test
the comprehensive test ban treaty is not applicable to india as it has not ratified the treaty . test
madam president , it is a very serious matter that india has conducted these tests since this could lead to a new global nuclear arms race . esperimenti
the citizens of the eu should do exactly what they did during the french nuclear tests , that is , to react with the instruments at their disposal . test
this is something we should also bear in mind when taking action against india 's nuclear weapons tests . test
madam president , since nuclear testing was resumed on mururoa under the aegis of the french president mr chirac , it was of course to be expected that such conduct would be copied by countries in asia and elsewhere . test
the five nuclear tests have changed the european parliament 's whole perspective on the strengthened partnership . esperimenti
i will therefore encourage the committee on foreign affairs , security and defence policy to consider that current circumstances are no longer conducive to strengthening the partnership ; on the contrary , they must lead to a temporary halt in the process until india has permanently stopped carrying out nuclear tests , has signed and ratified the non-proliferation and comprehensive test ban treaties and has begun to contribute actively towards improving relations between states in the region , more specifically with pakistan . esperimenti
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , like the previous speaker i find it extremely worrying that india has carried out these tests and that no criticism is coming from inside the country itself . esperimenti
in view of the arms race in the region , however , calling for india alone to put an end to testing would now seem to offer little chance of success . esperimenti
the european union must also ask itself whether , after the french tests in the pacific , it did not sit back a little in relief rather than making energetic calls for more countries to join up to the existing treaty . esperimenti
but even if there is a perception of neglect , i do not believe that this in any way justifies the act which the indian government has taken in carrying out those nuclear tests . test
but above all we must make sure that we give proper regard to the non-proliferation treaty and to the comprehensive test ban treaty and that these form the background to our discussion on 25 may . esperimenti
then yesterday at 5.00 p.m. , when almost no one was in the chamber , it was suddenly announced that today 's agenda had been changed and now we find ourselves in a situation where the debate on kosovo is due to take place after the debate on the nuclear tests in india has been squeezed in . esperimenti

at the moment we manage to be ill-prepared not just for the predictable , such as the indian test , or the perennial such as saddam hussein , but even for the frankly overdue such as kosovo . test
i will be frank with the european parliament and say that , although i welcome the fact that , on monday we were able to get a clear statement condemning the recent indian nuclear tests , it would have been better if that statement had been backed up by a more robust set of measures to give substance to our words . test
but there is no difference among the member states as to where we stand in relation to the nuclear tests . test
we believe they will fuel regional tensions and we believe also that it would be far better for the security of india and the other countries of the subcontinent if we could find a solution to kashmir which would be much more productive for an easing of tensions within the subcontinent than any amount of nuclear tests by either side . test
in addition to specific references to the mechanisms for preventing conflict , for which provision is made in the amsterdam treaty , the rapporteur has included an extremely balanced reference in his report to the recent nuclear tests in india and the thorny problem of the code of conduct for controlling the sale of arms . test
the reality is that every time a major confrontation develops - remember bosnia , think of kosovo today , think too of the nuclear tests in india - the general impression is that the european union seems powerless to act and fails to reach a consensus on how to react to actual developments outside its borders . test
fine , experience will be the test , and the next report will no doubt take a view on that . un
the european union will be tested repeatedly against the yardstick of its ability to act in foreign policy matters . a

first demand : as prevention is better than cure , we ask the commission to draw up a proposal for a europe test , by which all new legislation on taxation , social protection and employment matters would be subjected to preliminary and mandatory vetting for its effects on frontier workers . test
at european level , however , we think that the advisory committee on social security for migrant workers and the advisory committee on the free movement of workers would be best placed to consider the problem of frontier workers and could propose solutions for the problems which remain despite the europe test . test
of particular importance , and i hope to get a positive answer on that point too , is an element in this report which i already introduced here about six years ago , but then as " the commuting effect test ' , but what 's in a name ? test
the aim of what is referred to in this report as the europe test is to introduce an obligation to chart the effects of every amendment of social or fiscal legislation at member state level on commuters and ex-commuters . eurotest
finally , i would like to comment on the idea of the proposal for a directive on the introduction of a european test , whereby member states would be required to test their legislation on the effects they have on frontier workers . eurotest
but one question regarding the europe test . eurotest
i know that he was not so favourable to the idea of a europe test before , but i also know that the commission 's legal service has been investigating the question of the legal basis in the treaty . eurotest
can the commissioner confirm or deny that there is a legal basis for such a test , by which it would be possible to vet the social legislation of member states not only for its conformity with european law but also for its effects on frontier workers , which is another kind of test ? prova
the fact that angola , a one-party state , can take this decision without democratic consultation with the legal opposition represents a failure of the democratic lomé test . accetti

these tests , which our group immediately condemned , could easily revive the spread and proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide . esperimenti

so i hope the commission takes note that the instruments are there by which we could carry out testing and make sure that the harmonisation of homeopathic medicinal products with therapeutic indications is properly tested . controlli
in other words , given the particular problems surrounding the proving of homeopathy as against allopathic medicine , the pecular requirements of homeopathy should be taken into consideration in this testing and the expert knowledge of homeopaths applied . omeopatia

the commission shares the disappointment that has just been expressed by the presidency of the council that the united states senate rejected ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty . esperimenti
this regrettable vote may even offer encouragement to other countries in their nuclear aspirations and make them cross the threshold by testing their own nuclear devices . sperimentando
any such nuclear tests at this stage might undo all the work which has gone into the treaty . esperimenti
more seriously , they might trigger reciprocal actions in other countries through testing or through the strengthening of their nuclear programmes . esperimenti
following the nuclear tests by india and pakistan the commission has participated in the international taskforce set up to develop confidence and security-building measures and to engage these countries in constructive discussions on regional non-proliferation and arms control . test
we should do everything we can to convince congress of the importance of the comprehensive test ban treaty for ourselves , for the united states and for the international non-proliferation efforts . esperimenti
american opponents of treaties like the one we are debating today neglected the fact , he pointed out , that the united states has already stopped testing and that the treaty helped freeze the global development of nuclear weapons when america enjoys an enormous strategic advantage . esperimenti
among the arguments put forward in the united states , some people thought that it was not yet time to stop nuclear testing at a time when north korea is making efforts to develop its own weapons , and as china is continuing to build up its arsenal . test
others questioned the validity of simulation and felt that in order to ensure the long-term credibility of nuclear deterrence , they should not prohibit themselves going ahead with testing . sperimentazione
we have to point out to our american friends and partners the risk involved in this decision , because it encourages states such as pakistan and india - with the risk of all-out war - to continue with their nuclear tests . esperimenti
it is completely irresponsible to use ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty as a political football in an internal political dispute between the republican congress and the democratic president . esperimenti

mr president , the american senate ' s refusal to ratify the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty or ctbt is a setback for disarmament which i most particularly regret . esperimenti
this behaviour by the us senate is in conflict with the final declaration of the ctbt conference which , as the president-in-office of the council has mentioned , sat in vienna from 6 to 8 october and emphasised the importance of a comprehensive , verifiable ban on nuclear testing , as well as urging all states to sign and ratify this agreement quickly . esperimenti
through the failure of the nuclear test ban treaty in the united states , fresh impetus will be given to the suspicion on the part of third world nuclear powers and countries on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers that the non-proliferation treaty primarily serves to maintain the large nations ' nuclear status and discriminates against small countries .

the fact that a non-nuclear power like austria has signed and ratified the test ban treaty is no doubt laudable but will have no direct effects upon regional nuclear powers . esperimenti
mr president , i am very satisfied that the debate here in parliament has shown complete unanimity , and it is good that the commission , parliament and the council have very clearly emphasised the support of the european union for the test ban treaty . sperimentazione
it is unfortunate that the american senate has given the totally wrong signal in this issue , and especially the wrong signal to those countries that might still feel tempted to carry out nuclear testing . esperimenti

we now have the opportunity to make use of a test which will allow us to screen incubating animals . test
well , beside the compensation that i have just been talking about , i think that the only solution to this business is to make screening tests available as quickly as possible . test
one of these elements is application of the tests that are now available . test
i am not of the opinion that these tests should be used solely for placebo purposes , but in this regard as well we should base our decision , as indeed we have done , on scientific fact . test

however good the tests are , they are not one hundred percent reliable . test
so what different control systems are available to you across the community and how far have you got with the various tests , particularly the bse test which has been accepted by the commission ? test
there are , at present , four bse tests , three of them of the very highest reliability and the fourth one quite reliable . test
they are post-mortem tests . test
further work is on-going to try and achieve a situation whereby these tests , or a development of these tests , might well be used in a pre-clinical situation . test

are you now telling me mr byrne that during those three months when a vast dossier was prepared by the french food safety agency that they did not examine the technical implications embracing traceability , testing , derived products , controls and labelling ? test
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we all know that in the world of politics - i am sorry to say this - politicians always find it more attractive to come up with new ideas and at least launch their initial implementation than to complete and improve on existing , tried and tested concepts that do not attract so much media attention ! sperimentato
the council has certainly incorporated some important points in its common position , such as the two-stage stipulation of binding limit values , stricter durability provisions for emission control devices in lorries and buses , an on-board diagnostics system , and roadside testing . board
also , we give our full backing to the rapporteur ' s proposals to cut co2 emissions so that we can achieve the kyoto objectives , but also to the tax incentives for adapting older vehicles and the adjustment of test conditions , so that actual emissions of vehicles in use can be measured , albeit in the longer term . prova

within the discussions over the last few weeks , a number of issues were discussed , as you are probably aware , and one of the issues that was identified was the question of tests , as you rightly identify in your question . test
you draw attention to the fact that during my hearings on 3 september before the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , i mentioned that it was my intention to establish diagnostic testing for bse on an eu-wide basis . test
as i mentioned on that occasion , one of the purposes of establishing such a testing system is to ensure that there is an equal testing system throughout the european union so as to identify the levels of infectivity throughout the eu , and in particular to identify what further measures may be necessary . test
would you please be a little clearer about the issue of testing ? test
when will you present the house with a proposal to prescribe bse testing as compulsory in the european union ? test
in relation to the last part of your question , mrs roth-behrendt , dealing with tests , it is my intention to have something in place in relation to this by the end of the year . test
we agree whole-heartedly with that , and i would say one of the tests that we would have in the back of our minds as a group is this : in five years ' time will we have exported stability to south-eastern europe , or will we still be importing the consequences of instability ? test
i think the old adage of testing the ground by walking on it would be particularly wise in this case , mr solana . saggio

i believe that the commission 's answer to this is that the 1 % level is the only level at which we can be absolutely sure that the testing methods are available so that they can be firmly based in community law . metodi
are the testing methods available , and what about the supermarkets claims ? rispondete
all the tests we did , in testing that was widely and commercially available , showed even such maize occasionally contained between 1 and 2 % adventitious gm material . test
obviously , with time , anyone who makes the request and meets the requirements will be able to take their place at the political level , but today , if we do not proceed quickly in this direction and consider enlarging by almost doubling the number of member states without well thought out and tested institutional reforms - there is no time left to test them out - we are sounding the death knoll for the dream of a political union which is able to respect identities , cultures and traditions , but nevertheless contributes to the creation of a sperimentate
in the compromise forged between france and the commission and great britain , it was agreed that the tests should also be used for diagnostic purposes and that english beef from this export programme should be labelled . test
my question is this : if you institute treaty infringement proceedings without waiting for the results of the tests , when the tests have not even been carried out - we are still waiting for a proposal from commissioner byrne - and if the logistics for labelling have still not been set up , how then can you expect france and germany to lift their import restrictions with this state of affairs ? analisi

thus , it is crucial that the commission proposes new criteria for the testing and labelling of all new foods and processing aids derived from genetically modified organisms , paying particular attention to products obtained from animals fed with products containing gmos . analisi
nonetheless , it would have been nice if the commission had made the bse test evaluated several months ago compulsory , i.e. if they had made it a duty incumbent upon all member states . test
my question therefore to commissioner byrne is this : when will we have a proposal on compulsory bse testing in the member states ? test
apart from bse testing , we also need a record of provenance . test
make bse testing compulsory and ensure that beef is labelled with its origin , that would be a major step forward . test
what interests me in this respect , in the short time available to me , is this : if you state in this compromise , in these two recitals , that testing will be carried out and that there will be a facility or duty to label , then we must be sure that this testing and this labelling will indeed be carried out if the import ban is lifted . test
there are no logistics in place for either and no results from the possible application of this testing , including in great britain , have been submitted . test
you for your part , at the commission , should implement and test the measures agreed and then reintroduce them into the negotiations . verificare
it is the inadequacy of the guarantees on the definition and implementation of testing programmes and , in particular , the lack of european regulation on labelling and traceability , which has led france to this decision . test
to come to some of the issues that were raised by mrs roth-behrendt and mr graefe zu baringdorf , particularly with reference to the tests that are to be undertaken : you will remember that these were among the issues raised by the french authorities and addressed in the protocol of understanding . test
i said in my hearing last september that it was my intention to establish a proper eu-wide testing system for bse to determine the levels of infectivity in various member states . test
