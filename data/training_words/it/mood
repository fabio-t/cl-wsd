even though this notion is unpopular in this house - indeed the prevailing mood is the smaller the unit , the more divided the systems , and the more separatist the movements , the better - i would like to make the point here , which is one we have also discussed at some length in the delegation with our counterparts from macedonia , that we must be clear about the fact that their own albanian-language institutions should help to promote social cohesion in macedonia and not create divisions . predomina
